### Craig Gordon: 6

There was nothing much he could do about both the goals conceded, although he made a crucial second half save off Zahavi.

### Scott McTominay: 8

The Man Utd player had a quiet first half of the game, but stamped his authority in the second half and came up with a huge goal in the dying seconds of the game. Brilliant work by the young lad.

### Hendry: 7

Got his game off to a poor start as his free kick opened the door for Israel to take the lead.
However, the defender looked to make amends as he pulled out a few tackles and stepped forward to contribute to Scotland's attack.
He provided the final assist for McTominay's goal.

### Kieran Tierney: 8.5

He was the real driving force for Scotland in their back line.
His energy and commitment levels were through the roof as he was a part of Scotland's opening goal.

### Patterson: 6.5

The youngster struggled to make an impact in the first half. He had a slightly bigger influence in the game after the Scottish goal.

### John McGinn: 8.5

A real industrial performance from the Aston Villa midfielder which delivered a lot of goods and services.
Scored a brilliant opening goal as it curled into the net.

### Billy Gilmour: 7.5

Life is not going down well at Carrow road in Norwich for the Chelsea loanee, but the young lad showed why he is such a great prospect for the future.
He always kept looking for answers with the ball at his feet. Eventually, he will provide game-changing solutions to a game. It is impressive!

### McGregor: 6

The Celtic midfielder mostly swept up Israel's attack and helped his side push forward.

### Andrew Robertson: 7

The Liverpool left-back got off slow out of the blocks, but he could make up for his slow start and played many big roles during the game to keep Scotland within the reach of all 3 points.

### Che Adams: 6

The Southampton striker troubled the Israeli defence with his pace, but he missed an opportunity in the game.
He played a vital role in setting up McGinn's goal and did a lot of work off the ball, rather than on it.

### Dykes: 7.5

It was a difficult first half of the game for the Queens Park Rangers striker as he spooned his penalty, but he showed great resilient character to draw the score line at 2-2.

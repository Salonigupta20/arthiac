Let's put it this way:

### PSG 4-1 Real Madrid

Yeah, We'll get to that scoreline. But first, the main highlight of the day was that Kylian Mbappe had **admitted** that he wanted to **leave PSG** and play for **Real Madrid** in the 2021-22 season.

Here's what he had to say during his interview with RMC:

> _"I asked to leave, because at the moment that I did not want to extend my contract, I wanted the club to have a transfer fee to get a
> replacement of quality. PSG is a club that has brought me a lot. I
> have always been happy in the four years I have spent here, and I
> still am._ _I wanted everyone to come out of this stronger, that we
> leave hand in hand, to make a good deal and I respected that."_

He continued saying:

> _"People have said that I refused six or seven offers of extension, that I did not want to talk to Leonardo (Sporting Director at PSG).
> This is absolutely not true. They told me, 'Kylian, now you talk with
> the President.' Personally, I did not appreciate they said I (asked to
> leave) the last week of August. I said at the end of July that I
> wanted to go."_

He further explained his mental state during the transfer saga and said:

> _"It's scary when your president says, 'Kylian will never leave for free.' When I heard that, I swallowed hard and I said to myself, "but
> what's going to happen now"?_

Well, with all that has been said and done from the player himself, here's what Florentino Perez had to say today:

_"In January we will have news about Mbappe,"_ Perez told El Debate.

_"We hope that on January 1 everything can be solved."_

However, shortly after, Perez came out to clarify what he had actually meant.

> _"My words were misinterpreted. What I said is that we have to wait until next year to hear from him, always with respect to PSG, with
> whom we have good relations, "_ he said.

So, who's winning? Who's in the box-office seat?

Well, it's fair to say that PSG have to accept that they'll be losing Mbappe on a free transfer as the player does not want to renew his contract with the Parisian side.

However, it's Real Madrid that are looking to capture the signature of the talented French forward.

Kylian Mbappe is currently in his last year of contract with PSG, after which he will be a free agent in the summer of 2022.

Mbappe had stated earlier when he just broke onto the scene that his dream was to play for Real Madrid one day, and Real Madrid's president, Florentino Perez, has been keeping one eye on him amongst all the other things that the 74-year old has on his plate.

Earlier this summer, Perez made an attempt at signing Mbappe as he placed a first official bid of €160 million on the table for the chief executive of PSG to consider. That bid was turned down by the Parisian side and Real Madrid consequently went ahead with a second bid on the table with €180 million. That too was dropped and denied by the chief at PSG.

According to the report, it seemed like Real Madrid even made a third and final bid to sign Mbappe, but that too was denied by the French club.

Mbappe has already given Perez a few hints that he was willing to book a flight to the Spanish capital, Madrid, and be a Real Madrid player. That is huge for Los Blancos, given that the player himself has admitted that he would want to make it to the biggest club in Spain one day in the future.

Los Blancos were also reportedly tight when it came to their financials as they were hit by Covid, just as all other clubs. On top of that, Perez has gone ahead with the renovation of the Santiago Bernabeu which he began in the month of June, 2021.

However, Real Madrid was quietly doing extremely well in terms of finances, with La Liga reporting that Real Madrid had been a step ahead of the competition.

Real Madrid had taken a considerable number of cost-saving measures to compensate for the loss of income due to the pandemic. Real Madrid closed the 2020-21 financial year with a profit of £874,000 after tax, which was considerably more than what they had saved in the 2019-20 financial year, when they reported a profit of €313,000.

As little as €874,000 may seem to a big club like Real Madrid, the value of those numbers in a time such as this goes way beyond boundaries.

However, those numbers were a very tiny portion of the amount that Real Madrid would have to pay for the signing of Mbappe. €874,000 is barely a slice of a cake that you could afford.

Well, you may ask yourself if it makes **"sense"** for Real Madrid to go all out for a player that would be **free** in 11 months time.

The answer to that can go both ways.

- Florentino Perez is obsessed with signing the superstars that are available on planet Earth.

  Talk about Beckham, Zidane, Kaka, Roberto Carlos, Ozil, Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and many more in the club's iconic history.

  It would be easy to understand why he would go on and buy a player of the calibre that Kylian Mbappe has with the price tag being set on him.

  It's a sign that during his regime in the hottest seat in the city of Madrid, Perez has once again written his name in the history books, as he's got yet another **Galactico** at Real Madrid. Of course, there's a little bit of personal pride that he would achieve after the impact he has made at Real Madrid. He has every right to be proud of himself.

- With Mbappe set to become a free agent in 11 months, many top European clubs around the world will be keeping a close eye on him.

  Man City, Manchester United, Liverpool, and Chelsea are among the clubs that would like to have a player of his talent and calibre among their ranks.

  In that case, Perez is playing it safe by showing Mbappe that he needs him. He needs the quality of Mbappe to step inside that Real Madrid dressing room.

  These little things can go a long way in the future and show the commitment of a player towards a club and Perez? As successful as he has been in the past, he won't miss the opportunity to take the cherry off the cake.

## What does the scoreline suggest?

---

### PSG 1-0 RMA

Real Madrid scored the opening goal when Mbappe mentioned that he would want to play at Real Madrid in the near future, years ago.

### PSG RMA 1-2

PSG levelled the score line as they got their wish to keep Mbappe for yet another season after they had made their intentions clear that they would:

- They will not be selling Mbappe this season.

- Even if they would sell him, they would sell him at a much higher price tag.

- To top it off, they have said that they wouldn't let Mbappe go for free as the player has kept his word that he will go for a price tag in the future.

### PSG 2-1 RMA

Before Mbappe's interview with RMC, many players, including Benzema, had suggested that Mbappe had himself stated that he **would** play for Real Madrid in the future, which was for **certain**.

Even Fabrizio Romano, one of the most trusted football journalists out there, confirmed the above statements.

### PSG 3-1 RMA

With Mbappe giving the interview to RMC, he explained a lot of what he felt and what he had put on the table for PSG as he signalled his intention to leave the club by the end of July.

This gave the club a month to find a replacement for Mbappe, but they stuck with Mbappe by being tough in the media and regularly stating that they wouldn't be selling him.

Mbappe's interview with RMC has gone on to show that PSG were the culprit as they were too reluctant to let their star man go.

### PSG 4-1 RMA

Okay, maybe it's time to admit that this scoreline actually looks like Real Madrid have dominated the Parisian club.

Real Madrid have scored 4 because Kylian Mbappe has ensured that he is nowhere near signing a contract extension with PSG.

This makes him a free agent in the summer of 2022, and with the player already sending strong signals that he wants to be a Madridista, it looks much more likely that he will join Real Madrid for next season as a **free agent**.

**Imagine getting a player of that calibre for free!**

When and if Real Madrid sign him up, you could say that Los Blancos have brushed aside PSG at full time with Real Madrid winning **5-1**.

Brentford made the trip to London as they took on West Ham who recently took on Rapid Wien in the Europa League as the West Ham fans looked on with hope at their European side.

The game got off to an electric start from the visitors as Bryan Mbeumo rattled the bar from a richoted ball that arrived at his feet.

The bees kept pushing to take the lead and once again, Bryan Mbeumo got on the end of a cross, but his header was put wide of Fabianski's left-hand side.

It was brave of the Bees to come out at the London Stadium as they didn't come to watch the Hammers have the ball and dictate play on home soil.

They came out to **play**, take the **game on**, **pressurise** their opponents and be **brave** in their **approach** in every **stage** of this high-intensity game.

It was good to see them be in charge in the opening exchanges of the game as Brentford came forward with energy and thrust.

Ivan Toney brought out a save off the West Ham goalkeeper, Lucas Fabianski as the Bees asserted their own little recipe of the threat they have in line on Sunday afternoon.

However, West Ham were not shying away from what Brentford had in store for them as they got on the charge through Bowen as he surged forward which brought about a corner.

Kurt Zouma nearly found the net from that corner as West Ham grew into the game with the crowd behind their backs. From then on, the Hammers had calmed the Bee storm and asked questions of Brentford's defence.

Well, the Bees always find a way through to hunt you and Brentford took the lead through Mbeumo as Ivan Toney slid the ball through the hole in West Ham's defence as Lucas Fabianski pulled out a low save off a really good strike of Sergi Canos, but the Frenchman, Mbeumo reacted well to the rebound and squeezed it in just over the goal line as the referee, Peter Bankes declared that the ball had crossed over the line even though Fabianski had a desperate attempt to keep the ball within the goal line.

Replay's showed that the ball had crossed over the line by fine margins as Thomas Frank and his support staff were glad at the outcome and his boys were rewarded for their drive and quality.

West Ham are known for not setting in as they kept pushing as their attacking threat came in mostly from the wings in open play. At the same time, West Ham's Cresswell, who was on set-piece duty was on the money as he whipped his crosses in the box, but Brentford were up to the task with their aerial threat definitely.

The Hammers kept knocking at the door of Brentford as Said Benrahma tested the gloves of Brentford keeper David Raya, but the Hammers struggled to get going in the game, apart from a few beautiful deliveries down the sides which caused a lot of chaos in the Bees defensive line.

Vladimir Coufal broke through really well down the right wing as he nearly found Michail Antonio, but the Bees got it away through some crazy messy defending.

West Ham fans felt that they had the wind in their sales as there were 5 additional minutes of stoppage time as they encouraged their boys to keep threatening their opponents, but the Bees kept them out as they led 1-0 at half time.

The second-half got underway and Brentford once again looked to get going on the front foot in the game as the dark clouds rolled over the London Stadium as the rain came pouring which was probably a sign that the rain gods needed a much more impressive performance from the hosts.

Antonio started gaining some ground into the game as he bought a foul in a really good attacking position for the likes of Declan Rice and Said Benrahma to have a go at goal. In fact, it was Benrahma who went for goal from the free kick, but the Spanish keeper, David Raya tipped it over the bar.

The Hammers kept coming forward with pace and gaile as they came out with real intent at the start of the second-half. Antonio found himself through on goal, but his first touch let him down as the attack died down which forced Coufal to take a shot at goal which was wayward.

West Ham continued to create chances as Benrahma, Antonio and Bowen dragged the Bees defensive out of their comfort zone and created chances, but David Raya, Zanka, Jansson and Ethan Pinnock cleared it out of their territory with immediate effect.

The sheer drive and attacking threat of David Moyes and his boys caused a lot of problems for Brentford to deal with as Coufal chipped in a cross for Jared Bowen to head it in, but his attempt at goal was just wide, but West Ham felt that they were coming close.

However, Brenford came out with some street side defending as West Ham had vicious attempts on goal which was blocked and saved from the men in yellow.

David Raya was such a huge star for the Bees as he pulled out multiple saves time and time again to keep West Ham at bay for large portions of the game.

Brentford were unable to provide anything up front in the opening 20 minutes of the second half.

The Hammers levelled the scoreline as a rusty ball clearance from Brentford which saw Jarrod Bowen leather the ball low to David Raya's right as that goal blew the roof off at the London Stadium which added some spark to their game on a side that just played European football on

Antonio and Soucek got so close to take the lead as a vicious delivery from Declan Rice nearly found them, but the Bees were very lucky to escape that one.

However, the drama did not stop as West Ham's Angelo Ogbonna conceded a foul in a dangerous position on the pitch which saw Thomas Frank's men give it one last shot on goal.

Boy! Did they do that! Jansson headed the ball on target which forced a save from Fabianski, but the rebound was caught by Yoane Wissa as he leathered the ball into the back of the net as Brentford secured a scintillating win at the London Stadium as they have surely made their presence felt to every other team around them.

That foul from West Ham's Italian defender cost David Moyes a point as they head into the International break on a sour note.

Brentford go into 7th place in the table with 12 points on board as they will be over the moon during the international break while the Hammers sit in 9th place in the Premier League table with 11 points besides their positioning on the table.

## Player Ratings: West Ham

- **Fabianski: 6/10** - He made a few good saves and he was unfortunate for both the goals that he had conceded.

His deliveries from the back were not precise.

- **Coufal: 5.5/10** - Didn't start the game well. He had a really good opportunity to level the scoreline for the Hammers, but he failed to convert that chance.

Gave the ball away many times.

- **Zouma: 5/10** - Found it extremely difficult to handle the pace of Mbeumo and Ivan Toney, but he made the recovery in time.

He also missed an opportunity in front of goal from a header.

- **Ogbonna: 4.5/10** - He seriously found it difficult to contain Toney and Mbeumo. His error in the dying minutes of the game cost a point for David Moyes.
- **Cresswell: 6.5/10** - He was more certain at the back and questioned the Brentford back line through his set-piece delivery.
- **Declan Rice: 6/10** - Struggled to get forward and make a significant impact in the game. Did most of the dirty work in midfield.
- **Soucek: 5/10** - A bad day at the office for the Czech international. Didn't make a difference with his height.
- **Fornals: 6/10** - He found it very difficult to get going in the first-half of the game, but he managed to improve slightly.
- **Said Benrahma: 6.5/10** - Had 2 good attempts at goal which tested Raya, but he will be disappointed as he couldn't make a significant impact in the game to break the deadlock.

- **Bowen: 7.5/10** - As always, Bowen is phenomenal when his pace and drive on the ball.

Found the back of the net with real precision.

- **Antonio: 7/10** - He looked to torment the Bees defence with his pace, but he couldn't shrug them off to make something happen. Worth the effort though as he was the only bright spark for West Ham.

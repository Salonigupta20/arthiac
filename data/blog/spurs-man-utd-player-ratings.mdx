## Tottenham

---

### Hugo Lloris: 2

Had a bad day in the office in between the sticks as he was well beaten in all three goals.

### Emerson Royal: 3

Looked to push forward on multiple occasions, but he couldn't make a significant difference with his passing or movement off the ball.

Exploited by Marcus Rashford's goal.

### Cristian Romero: 3

Started the game quite well when he was able to shut down Ronaldo, but his performance on the field was much more theatrical off the ball.

He found the net once, but was ruled out for offside.

Caught napping for Man Utd's third goal.

### Eric Dier: 4

He was the only decent performer in the Spurs backline. Was left without help for Rashford's goal. He nearly got an assist in the game too.

### Ben Davies: 2

Had an awful day on his return to the starting XI. He put in a rusty defensive performance which was expected.

His aerial weakness was exploited in the opening goal from Ronaldo.

### Hojbjerg: 3

He was quiet in midfield today. He won a few 50-50 challenges, but was far from creating anything for the likes of Son and Kane up front.

### Oliver Skipp: 2

Lost possession a few times and he was another player who had a bad outing.

### Lo Celso: 2

The Argentine was just not able to pull the strings in midfield for Nuno and his boys.

He didn't get the team moving forward many times given that he has a lot of quality on his left boot. Added to the frustration of the fans.

### Lucas Moura: 4

He was not contributing much defensively as he failed to mark the wing backs of Man Utd.

He created a good opportunity for Son in the first half and he was subbed off early in the second half.

### Heung-min Son: 3

The South Korean couldn't make the most out of the opportunities created by his teammates. Poor.

### Harry Kane: 1

We're not sure if he even deserves that rating.

He continuously dropped deep to receive the ball (which is understandable to some extent), but couldn't make the most of it when he intercepted a pass from Cavani and ran through in front of goal. His chipped pass was awful.

He is clearly not in a frame of mind to play for Spurs at this point of time.

## Substitutes

### Steven Bergwijn: 2

He came early on in the second half in place of Lucas Moura, but he failed to make an impression by stretching the Red Devils backline.

### Tanguy Ndombele: N/A

The midfielder couldn't bring his thrust and finesse for Spurs in the attacking half as he spent a lot of time deep in the Tottenham set-up.

### Dele: N/A

Horrible.

## Man Utd

### David De Gea: 6

Had a day out in the park in London.

### Victor Lindelof: 6.5

The Swede had the answers for the little that Spurs had asked him.

### Raphael Varane: 7.5

He marshalled the United backline and he was a colossal figure in the heart of the back three that Ole had set-up.

A Champion performance from the French centre-back.

### Maguire: 6

He played in a position where Gareth Southgate uses him mostly in the England squad and he had a fair few interceptions in the game.

### Aaron Wan-Bissaka: 7

According to us, we've rated him at 7 due to the "effort" he has put in.

His effort in the attacking and defensive half for Man Utd was truly inspiring as his work ethic was a sign of how Man Utd approached the game.

His end product is still a big downfall as he is not able to put in a good delivery into the box on a continuous basis.

Made a stunning block off Son's effort on target in the first half.

### Scott McTominay: 7.5

The Scottish defensive midfielder was so good on a night when he had to step in and dominate at the centre of the park for his side.

He worked hard off the ball and snatched the ball many times and kept Man Utd on the front foot for most of the game.

Impressive from the young lad.

### Fred: 6

The Brazilian was once again caught in position multiple times as he kept the ball at his feet for too long while Spurs came and snatched it away from him.

He had a shot on target which was well taken as he tested the gloves of Hugo Lloris.

### Luke Shaw: 5

The left back was booked early on in the game, but he did well not to get cautioned again in the game.

Linked up pretty well with Ronaldo on the left wing, but he still lacked being precise when he delivered the ball onto the on rushing Bruno Fernandes and Edinson Cavani.

### Bruno Fernandes: 8

The Portuguese midfielder had to step up tonight after a string of poor performances by his standards in recent weeks.

He picked up multiple pockets of space in the heart of Spurs' midfield and delivered a sublime assist for the opening goal.

Contributed to the defensive cause as well for Manchester United in the second-half.

### Edinson Cavani: 8

He was included in the starting XI along with Ronaldo. His experience and quality on and off the pitch made a huge difference in the game.

He took his goal really well which calmed the nerves of many Man Utd fans when he dinked the ball over the onrushing diving Lloris.

He'll have a big role in the remainder of the season for the Red Devils.

### Cristiano Ronaldo: 9

The Portuguese superstar was in a league of his own when he scored that sensational opener for his side. That was a "World. Class. Finish" without a shadow of a doubt.

He did really well to find Cavani as he earned himself an assist where he did brought along his traditional chop inside and creamed a forward pass to Cavani.

He didn't show much in the defensive aspect of the game, but that's not what Man Utd will get on a regular basis for the 36 year old.

However, his teammates need to work extensively to deliver the ball to him. Bruno is the only one who is able to find Ronaldo regularly.

A week ago, Ronaldo stated that he would still continue to shut his critics and he did.

Infact, he's got two goal involvements a few days after he announced that he and his girlfriend are expecting twins. A fatherly gift from the man himself, Cristiano Ronaldo.

## Substitutes

### Marcus Rashford: 7.5

The youngster came on as a substitute for Ronaldo and scored the killer goal which definitely sealed three points for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

### Nemanja Matic: 6

The Serbian came on for Bruno Fernandes in the second half to ensure that Man Utd didn't concede.

He shut down Spurs' attack and got himself an assist where he set up Rashford for the third goal.

### Jesse Lingard: N/A

Came on with 10 minutes left on the clock and didn't do much when he had the ball.

He barely made a difference during his time on the field. His workload was mostly in the defensive half.

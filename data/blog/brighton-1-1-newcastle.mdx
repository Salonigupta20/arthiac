## Brighton & Hove Albion

### 1. Robert Sanchez: 4

The Spanish second-choice keeper didn't have much to do in the first half of the game, but the Magpies tested him in the second half.

He made a couple of errors while passing the ball out from the back. Was rightly sent off for a challenge on Wilson.

### 2. Joel Veltman: 5.5

He did well considering that he partnered in a back 3 alongside Duffy and Dunk while Lamptey and Cucurella bursted forward. Delivered a wicked ball into the box in the first half from the right wing side of the Seagulls attack.

### 3. Shane Duffy: 6.5

The centre back was once again very solid in the heart of Brighton's defence. Teamed up really well with his evergreen partner in Dunk.

He had an attempt on target as his header was saved by Darlow. Reliable once again!

### 4. Lewis Dunk: 6

The Seagull captain led really well from the back marshalling all that it's front of him.

He read the game well and kept Brighton in the game even though Newcastle kept knocking on the door.

Took on the glove work in the final few minutes of stoppage time.

### 5. Marc Cucurella: 7

The Spanish left back was a constant menace down the left hand side for Graham Potter.

He continued to burst down the wing on multiple occasions and linked up really well with his teammates. He's in the making of being alongside the best left backs in the Premier League.

### 6. Tariq Lamptey: 7

The highly talented right back played way further upfront. He almost played as a right winger in the game.

He provided a huge driving force on the right-hand side and caused many threats down his attacking side.

He gave Newcastle's Matt Ritchie a really tough time.

### 7. Yves Bissouma: 6

The midfielder who was subject to a transfer away from the Amex once again showed why he is highly sought after by the big boys.

Got booked as the game came to a close.

### 8. Enock Mwepu: 6

The Zambian has been exceptional for Brighton once again as he linked up well with those in and around the midfield.

He was subbed off in the second half of the game. Not known why he was subbed off but he was ready to receive the ball and push forward.

### 9. Adam Lallana: 7

The ex-Liverpool midfielder stood out for Brighton in this game as he took the ball forward on multiple occasions taking on defenders.

Brought his experience into the fold when Brighton pressed forward. Got booked for a challenge on Saint-Maximin.

### 10. Solly March: 6.5

He looked to constantly support Cucurella up front and got things moving along really well in midfield.

He also missed a chance to score a goal as his header on goal went out wide.

### 11. Leandro Trossard: 8.5

He was really lively as always throughout the game.

He constantly looked up in front of him to get his team forward. Earned a penalty in the game and converted it sweetly through the centre of the net.

He linked up really well with everyone around him and made a difference in the game. He bore the brunt of many challenges from the Brighton players.

## Substitutes

### 12. Alexis Mac-Allister: 4.5

Came on at the start of the second half in place of Mwepu to open up a few doors in midfield for Brighton after their impressive first half.

Couldn't do much with Newcastle came out with much higher intensity in the second 45.

### 13. Neal Maupay: 3

He got booked during the closing stages of the game.

### 14. Adam Webster: N/A

# Newcastle

### 1. Karl Darlow: 6

Made a few decent saves along with a big save from Trossard during the game.

He was well beaten by Trossard's penalty.

### 2. Emil Krafth: 4.5

He was dodgy during the game and he wasn't able to contain the Brighton attack.

### 3. Jamaal Lascelles: 4

With his towering figure, the centre back was expected to assert his dominance in the heart of the Magpies defensive five, but he too couldn't make a difference.

Got booked for bringing down Trossard.

### 4. Ciaran Clark: 5.5

He had a pretty mixed evening at the Amex stadium as he made a clumsy tackle to bring down Trossard and conceded a penalty.

However, he made up for his error as he assisted Hayden for the equalizing goal.

### 5. Jacob Murphy: 5

He couldn't link up well with Saint-Maximin and Wilson. Got booked in the game and gave away possession of the ball.

### 6. Isaac Hayden: 6.5

He did all the dirty work in midfield for Newcastle as he chased and mopped up many second balls in midfield.

He did really well to get in the firing zone and seal the equalizing goal.

### 7. Jonjo Shelvey: 4

He had a really poor day in the office. He couldn't bring out his quality on the night. He was ultimately poor when he was on set piece duty as well.

### 8. Matt Ritchie: 5

He had a tough time containing Lamptey's pace as he had to be on his heels for most parts of the game.

### 9. Miguel Almiron: 4

Had a poor time during his stay on the field. He looked to provide solutions, but the Brighton players came along and stole the ball from him.

### 10. Callum Wilson: 5

The striker couldn't make any significant contribution in the game as he was left isolated up front for most parts of the game.

However, he did give a slight glimmer of hope for the Magpies when he burst through with pace at the end of the game and got Sanchez sent off.

### 11. Allan Saint-Maximin: 5.5

The electric French forward began the game with a spark, but he couldn't continue with that same spark and delight when he was on the ball for the rest of the game.

Although, he must be given credit for his work ethic while he was off the ball.

## Substitutes

### 12. Joelinton: 4

The attacker just couldn't bring along some added pace with his arrival down the wings as he gave away possession cheaply.

### 13. Gayle: N/A

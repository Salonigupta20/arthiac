Well, we need to keep travelling and moving around. Shouldn’t we? Up front, we travel to the city of Manchester. To be precise, we travel to the "Blue" side of Manchester. Here, we will look at what Pep Guardiola’s boys have in store for FPL managers.

It was a Premier League season to remember for Manchester City as they clinched yet another Premier League title, which was their third Premier League title in four seasons. Their fans must be really happy with the recent success that their boys in blue have been able to deliver.

They’ve got some very exciting young prospects within their team that are more than capable of hunting for more glory in the years to come.

In the 2020-21 season, Manchester City had a spectacular winning streak this season, which lasted for 82 days from December - March 2021. During this run, City equaled their club record for the most consecutive wins by a top-flight English team in all competitions, as well as the most consecutive league wins by a top-flight team from the beginning of a calendar year. During that time, City also achieved an English record for consecutive away league wins.

Manchester City added to their trophy cabinet when they defeated Spurs 1-0 at Wembley in the month of April.

The Citizens also had a chance to add more confetti to their trophy cabinet as they went out to seek Champions League glory against Chelsea. Sadly, Manchester City ended up on the wrong side of the result.

Having said that, Pep Guardiola will not stop eyeing up the Champions League this season as they will go out once again to hunt for the trophy that they have never had in their entire history.

**Have we gone too far in speaking about their success?**

Back to business FPL managers! Let’s take a look at Manchester City in the 2020-21 Premier League season.

Manchester City's Premier League season started against Wolverhampton Wanderers as they got off to a bright start by winning 3-1 against the Wolves. But, things started to tail off for the Citizens since they welcomed Leicester City at the Etihad, where they suffered a 5-2 defeat at home. Moving forward, things were slightly off balance as Manchester City drew 1-1 with Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds United. The following week, Manchester City had a convincing victory against Arsenal, winning 1-0. On the 8th of November 2021, City drew with Liverpool at the Etihad stadium. Consequently, they suffered a defeat against Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur.

This series of draws and defeats were followed by another draw against their derby rivals Manchester United and the already relegated West Bromwich Albion.

It was on the 19th of December 2020, when Manchester City began their title winning run. They won convincingly against Southampton 1-0, which was the start of their impressive winless streak that ran from December until March. During their winning streak, they defeated Chelsea 3-1, Aston Villa 2-0, Liverpool 4-1, Tottenham Hotspur 3-0, Everton 3-1, Arsenal 1-0 and West Ham United 2-1, which were among a few notable victories for the men in blue.

This winning streak came to an end when they lost to their derby rivals, Manchester United. This loss ended their impressive winning streak, but on the other hand, it still kept Manchester City in pole position at the top of the Premier League table.

After the loss against Manchester United, Manchester City trashed Southampton 5-2, which was a result that further cemented their position at the top of the Premier League table. A few weeks down the line, Manchester City lost 2-1 at home to Leeds United, which was another contender for the games of the 2020-21 season.

On the 8th of May 2021, Manchester City lost to Chelsea, which was not pleasing to Pep Guardiola and his support staff. A few down the line, Manchester City lost once again. This time, it was against Brighton and Hove Albion. This game was definitely another Premier League game of the 2020-21 season. (Oh, just a friendly reminder, if you didn’t watch the highlights of that game, then you should!). Manchester City rounded off their title winning campaign by smashing five against Carlo Ancelotti’s Everton.

## What to Expect from Manchester City in FPL?

Certainly, if you have been in the FPL game for a minimum of 2 seasons , you will know that Manchester City are all about _**"Pep Roulette"**_

As FPL managers, we cannot assume who is going to be a regular starter at Manchester City. Pep Roulette has always been a factor that FPL managers needed to consider before making an investment in their assets.

Even in the _**biggest of games**_, _**the biggest names**_ in that City squad find themselves on the bench. But as an FPL manager, you will need to be bold to get a City asset into your FPL squad. Besides being bold, you need some fortune as well.

But, here is a thing, Ederson in between the posts is a nailed-on asset. If you are willing to spend on his price tag, you are guaranteed to get FPL points.

In this article, we will be looking at Manchester City’s assets that are worth considering in your FPL teams. As always, we look into every department that the "The Citizens" have to offer for FPL managers around the world that would want to consider a potential opening for an asset (s) from the blue side of Manchester to enter their teams.

## **Players as "Potential" Regular Starters**

### Goalkeepers

1. **Ederson** - £**6.0m** - The Brazilian keeper won the Golden Glove award for the second time in a row in the 2020-21 Premier League season. Ederson is not a compelling goalkeeping option because he rarely earns bonus or save points.

   But, he is guaranteed to keep clean sheets and his teammates, especially his defensive mates, do an impressive job of leaving him with little to do.

   Despite all this, the Brazilian international is a clean sheet keeper, keeping more (19) than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League last season. He is definitely a nailed-on starter for Pep Guardiola provided that he is injury free. (Which he usually is).

   Last season, in the Premier League, Ederson made **36 appearances** in which he scored a total of **160 FPL points**. On an average, he provided FPL managers with **4.44 points per game**.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   As a goalkeeper, his returns per game are still worth considering if you decide to invest in him. The only factor that may put you off is his price tag. There are many other keepers who provide **FPL points in a similar range** at a much **lower price,** such as Martinez (£5.5m), Pope (£5.5m), Meslier (£5.5m), Lloris (£5.5m) and Fabianski (£5.0m).

   **Our Opinion?**

   He has a really good left foot on him which is capable of supplying long-range assists. If you require stable FPL points, Ederson should be your man without a doubt.

   But, as we mentioned earlier, there are keepers at a cheaper price point that provide FPL points in a similar range or even higher, just as Emi Martinez did last season.

   You can cut down on your investment in a goalkeeper and use those saved FPL funds in your defence, midfield or even attack.

### Defenders

1. **Dias** - **Centre-back** - £**6.0m** - Last season, Ruben Dias was a regular starter for Manchester City, which is a rare case under the management of Pep Guardiola.

   He was extremely important in Manchester City's winning streak from December to March. Since his arrival on the blue side of Manchester, Pep Guardiola’s reliance on Ruben Dias has gone beyond boundaries. The arrival of the Portuguese centre-back has stabilized Manchester City’s defense and made them Premier League title winners.

   His presence in Manchester City's defence was extremely positive, to the extent that it provided John Stones with the licence to go forward and unleash his goal scoring potential and provide a few match-winning goals for "The Citizens."

   Ruben Dias immediately found a way into Pep Guardiola's starting XI. Having said that, in the 2020- 21 Premier league season, Ruben Dias scored one goal.

   Additionally, he is a commanding figure in defence and he also possesses a really good attacking threat when he is in the opposition's penalty box.

   He is physically strong and he has been in many situations where he has put himself on the line to make a defensive block. As an FPL manager, you always require defenders such as Ruben Dias to provide and come in with those tackles that will provide you with a clean sheet and bonus points by the end of the game.

   His impressive performances in Manchester City's jersey have even granted him a regular starting spot in Portugal's starting XI.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   Ruben Dias currently sits at **26.9% of FPL squads worldwide**. Last season, he scored a total of **142 FPL points** in **32 Premier League appearances**. On average, Ruben Dias provided **4.43 FPL points per game**.

   If you look closely, there are many other FPL defenders who are available at a cheaper price point and have a much better potential to score more FPL points than Ruben Dias. In fact, there are **very few defenders** who have shown that they are much more capable of providing greater FPL point returns than Ruben Dias at **£6.0m**.

   A few defenders that you can look at that have the potential to provide better FPL returns are Cresswell (£5.5m), Targett (£5.0m), Stones (£5.5m) and Shaw (£5.5m).

   Yes, the defenders mentioned above have not scored more FPL points than Dias except for Cresswell, but his **£6.0m** price tag might put you off.

   **Our Opinion? -** It would be ideal for FPL managers to select defenders that provide much more attacking returns. The likes of **Alexander-Arnold (£7.5m)**, **Cresswell (£5.5m)**, **Chilwell (£6.0m)**, **Cancelo (£6.0m**), **Shaw (£5.5m)** and **Stones (£5.5m)** are a few names that you can consider as an FPL manager to invest in your FPL squad. Ruben Dias has not shown enough attacking potential, but he has always been at the heart of Manchester City’s defence.

   Manchester City have gone in many games this season where they have taken a balanced **"goal-scoring" approach** to games. It has not been the same old story where Manchester City always looked for goals up front only. They have tightened themselves up a lot at the back and they are expected to carry this same approach into the upcoming Premier League season.

   This gives Ruben Dias a much better opportunity to get additional bonus points during a game if Manchester City keep a clean sheet.

2. **Cancelo** - **Right-back** - £**6.0m** - At £6.0m, Cancelo has been classified as a premium FPL asset for fantasy managers to consider. Pep Guardiola has constantly rotated cancelo on a regular basis in the 2020-21 Premier League season.

   But, the upside of having Cancelo in your FPL team is that he has been given the licence to bomb forward on a regular basis and contribute to Manchester City's goals.

   He has played a huge part in the way Manchester City press forward and catch teams off-guard. Cancelo has been deployed in midfield on multiple occasions because of his flair and pace up-front.

   He is admired by Pep Guardiola, which is why he finds himself in the midfield role. He also has a really good right foot in him which is capable of supplying venomous deliveries into the box for the forward men of Manchester City to capitalise on.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   According to us, Cancelo is worth the investment only for a few weeks. You will have to shift him in and out of your fpl squads on a regular basis. He doesn't get many opportunities as a regular starter. When Cancelo is on song, it is important that we catch the bus immediately because he will have the potential to provide regular FPL points as well as bonus points for his owners.

   In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Cancelo has made **28 appearances,** out of which he has recorded **2 goals** and provided **3 assists** for himself. In FPL terms, he has scored a total of **138 points**. On average in his **28 Premier League appearances**, Cancelo has scored a total of **4.92 FPL points per game**. Considering the amount of minutes that he played last season, his FPL returns are **highly impressive** as they indicate that he has a lot of attacking potential whenever he gets on the pitch.

   **Our Opinion?**

   If you have the investment to make in Cancelo, identify and guess when he might start and get on that bus as quickly as possible.

3. **Stones** - **Centre-back** - £**5.5m** - Last season, John Stones was exceptional in defence and in attack as well. John Stones has been one of the primary candidates for Manchester City in front of goal, whether it was from corners, open play or even from indirect set pieces.

   The arrival of Ruben Dias has transformed the way John Stones has approached the game. Pep Guardiola deserves a lot of credit since he identified the attacking potential of John Stones.

   At the same time, John Stone has been a regular starter at the heart of Manchester City's defence along with Ruben Dias.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   In the 2020-21 Premier League season, John Stones made **22 appearances** in total. In those 22 Premier League appearances, John Stones scored a total of **4 goals** in which he recorded **128 FPL points.**

   On average, John Stones provided **5.81 FPL points per game**. This goes to show that he is a colossal asset for Manchester City when it comes to goals.

   These figures also show that whenever John Stones is given the opportunity to be on the field, he is guaranteed to provide FPL points on a regular basis.

   There are much better FPL options at the same price tag who are guaranteed starters, such as **Cresswell** and **Shaw,** who are both priced at **£5.5m**. An investment in them would be wise

   **Our Opinion?**

   Get on board as quickly as you can with him. But, he will be rotated regularly by Pep Guardiola.

### Midfielders

1. **De Bruyne (KDB) - £12.0m** - There are not enough words to describe the quality that KDB has in his boots. In the 2020-21 Premier League season, KDB made a total of 25 Premier League appearances.

   Considering his talent and quality on the ball, you would expect him to start many more games than usual for Manchester City. Unfortunately, he has been hit by injuries and has been rested as well on multiple occasions.

   In 25 appearances, KDB played a total of 2001 minutes.

   He is perfectly capable of having an outstanding season at 30 years of age. He will be looking to have much more authority in that Man City dressing room as a leader on and off the pitch.

   **Worth the Investment?**

   Definitely! No doubt about it. If he gets rolling right between gameweek 1-5, then there is no doubt that he will be out there tempting FPL managers to get him into their fantasy squads.

   Even during the course of the season, KDB will find his groove and hit the roof with his assist numbers. Adding to that, he also has the eye of a tiger to score a glorious goal time and time again.

   Additionally, he is also on set-piece duty and he is the primary taker of any free-kicks in and around the area.

   Last season, he scored a total of **141 FPL points** in **25 Premier League appearances**. On average, he scored **5.64 FPL points per game,** which is equivalent to scoring assist points per game. Below are his stats for Manchester City:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2015-16 | 25      | 7     | 9       |
   | 2016-17 | 36      | 6     | 18      |
   | 2017-18 | 37      | 8     | 16      |
   | 2018-19 | 19      | 2     | 2       |
   | 2019-20 | 35      | 13    | 20      |
   | 2020-21 | 25      | 6     | 12      |

   **Our Opinion?**

   If he rolls up his socks at the start of the season, then Pep Guardiola cannot afford to keep KDB sitting out on the bench.

2. **Sterling** - £**11.0m** - Sterling had a very quiet Premier League campaign last time out. He wasn’t able to get his scoring boots on as he bottled many opportunities in front of the goal.

   However, as FPL managers, we need to consider form as well. At the 2020 Euros, Sterling was a man on fire as he scored 3 goals and provided 1 assist.

   The issue with Sterling is that he is not considered as a premium asset that people would invest in with a lot of trust. He has not been at his best last season as his price tag is questionable.

   But, the young winger still has a lot of attacking threat in him. Last season, he scored **10 goals** and provided **7 assists** in the Premier League.

   If you look at it, those numbers are not bad, especially when you play in a Manchester City squad where the goals and points are spread across many players.

   **Worth the Investment?**

   He is worth it for a few weeks only. It has always been an issue with him that he is not consistent enough to provoke FPL managers to get him in their teams.

   There is a lot of flair in his game, but he struggles to find the back of the net week in-week out.

   With that price tag, a lot more is expected of the winger, but it seems as though he is struggling to keep up with the expectations.

   In FPL terms, Sterling scored a total of **154 FPL points** in **31 appearances**. On an average, he scored **4.96 FPL points per game.**

   Here are his stats at Man City:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2015-16 | 31      | 6     | 2       |
   | 2016-17 | 33      | 7     | 6       |
   | 2017-18 | 33      | 18    | 11      |
   | 2018-19 | 34      | 17    | 10      |
   | 2019-20 | 33      | 20    | 1       |
   | 2020-21 | 31      | 10    | 7       |

   **Our Opinion?**

   Pep Guardiola lost trust in him at the back-end of last season. He will score in between the course of a season.

   He is not a nailed on starter every week, especially with the likes of Jack Grealish coming into this Manchester City squad. If his stats convince you, then invest in him. There’s no stopping you from that.

3. **Mahrez** - £**9.0m** - Here is a head start..... He just loves playing against Burnley. He has scored loads of goals against them.

   Riyad Mahrez is a player that you pick when Manchester City play against smaller teams. Manchester City play Norwich and Southampton in gameweek 2 and 5 respectively. He will also be playing against his former club Leicester City in gameweek 4.

   If you are willing to take a punt on Mahrez for 2-3 weeks, then go for it. But, his minutes will be shared alongside Bernardo Silva.

   Here are his stats in a Manchester City shirt:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2018-19 | 27      | 7     | 4       |
   | 2019-20 | 33      | 11    | 9       |
   | 2020-21 | 27      | 9     | 6       |

   When it comes to FPL, as the stats suggest, he made a total of 27 Premier League appearances, which indicates that he is in and out of the side, which is something that FPL managers should also do.

   He scored a total of **145 FPL points** in **27 appearances**. On an average, he provided **5.37 FPL points per game played**. This is not a bad statistic for a player that is in and out of the starting XI.

   Again, there are many other FPL assets at **£7.5m** or **even below** that are **guaranteed** to get **more minutes** and **score more FPL points** this season, with the likes of **Havertz (£8.5m)**, **Mount (£7.5m)**, **Jota (£7.5m)**, **Greenwood (£7.5m)**, **Maddison (£7.0m)**, **Barnes (£7.0m)**, **Saka (£6.5m)**, **Buendia (£6.5m)**, **Raphinha (£6.5m)** and many more.

   **Our Opinion?**

   It may be the same case with Mahrez as well, but we expect him to play a lot more this season, especially in the Premier League. He is a primary candidate for Man City along with KDB for taking penalties.

4. **Foden** - £**8.0m** - Last season, Foden started just 17 games out of the 28 appearances that he made for Manchester City in the Premier League.

   There is no doubt regarding the young, exciting talent that Phil Foden has in store for football and Premier League fans. Pep Guardiola went on and mentioned that he feels that Foden is much better than Lionel Messi when the latter was at the age of Phil Foden.

   Well, we won’t open that can of worms!

   Moving forward, it is difficult to predict when Foden will start or not. He is sure to get even more minutes this season as he has matured into a much better player, but the question always arises whether he will get regular playing minutes for FPL managers to consider at a whopping £8.0m price tag.

   **Worth the Investment?**

   Last season, in 28 Premier League appearances, Phil Foden scored 9 goals and supplied 5 assists for Manchester City.

   In FPL terms, Phil Foden scored a total of **135 FPL points**. On average, he scored a total of **4.81 FPL points per game** that he played.

   Again, there are many other FPL assets at **£7.5m** or **even below** that are **guaranteed** to get **more minutes** and **score more FPL points** this season, with the likes of **Mount (£7.5m)**, **Jota (£7.5m)**, **Greenwood (£7.5m)**, **Maddison (£7.0m)**, **Barnes (£7.0m)**, **Saka (£6.5m)**, **Buendia (£6.5m)**, **Raphinha (£6.5m)** and many more.

   **Our Opinion?**

   It’s the same case with almost all Man City assets, as you have to get on the bus as soon as you possibly can!

5. **Gundogan** - £**7.5m** - Last season, Gundogan was in the goal-scoring form of his life. He made a total of **28 appearances** in the **Premier League last season**. Even so, he has scored a total of **13 goals** (which is the highest among his teammates) and provided **2 assists.**

   He is generally known for his supply, but last season, when a lot of Manchester City’s midfielders were injured, he stood up for the team.

   **Worth the investment?**

   At **£7.5m**, Gundogan is going to be a really good FPL differential player during the course of the Premier League season.

   He is currently sitting at just **5.9%** of FPL squads all over the world. At the same time, he is also going to be a part of the Peps rotation policy.

   If Manchester City is faced with another situation where a number of their key players are injured, then Gundogan is really going to be at the forefront of Manchester City's goal scoring attacking prowess.

   In FPL terms, Gundogan scored a total of **157 FPL points** from **28 Premier League appearances**. On an average, he scored **5.60 FPL points per game,** which is **equivalent** to **assisting every match**.

   Considering the price point that Gundogan is at, FPL managers can decide to invest in Gundogan depending on whether they are sure that he will start or not.

   There are many other FPL assets at **£7.5m** or **even below** that are **guaranteed** to get **more minutes** and **score more FPL points** this season, with the likes of **Mount (£7.5m)**, **Jota (£7.5m)**, **Greenwood (£7.5m)**, **Maddison (£7.0m)**, **Barnes (£7.0m)**, **Saka (£6.5m)**, **Buendia (£6.5m)**, **Raphinha (£6.5m)** and many more.

   **Our Opinion?**

   **His form is key**. If he shows signs of scoring goals, find a way to get him in but, remember that it will be only for a few weeks. It has to be said that he is **not very attractive at £7.5m**.

6. **Grealish** - £**8.0m** - Do refer to our article on Aston Villa [here](https://arthiac.com/blog/fpl-deep-dive-aston-villa).

Sunday the 28th of February 2021 will be a day that will go down memory lane for the Spurs faithful. Gareth Bale finally found his scoring boots once again after a lengthy spell on and off the pitch. The Welshman scored a brace in Tottenham’s rampant 4-0 performance against an ordinary Burnley side who’ve been torn apart by the Lightning pace of Son and Bale down the flanks. Gareth Bale took 68 seconds to open the scoring thanks to Son. Spurs were blistering on the Counter-Attack with Kane setting the platform for Spurs to break. There were ample positives for Jose Mourinho and his men, but if there was one positive that Jose would take is the return of Gareth Bale. He’s dropped the pressure off him by starting Bale alongside Son and Kane.

For Burnley, it’s gone from bad to worse right from the first minute. They’ve been off their original standards. Burnley are known for their stubborn defending throughout the season. Nick Pope, Ben Mee and James Tarkowski have been the testimony to Burnley’s season. A result such as this would be a huge blow for Sean Dyche as this result could be the difference between relegation and a Premier League season. Sean Dyche would want to put this result to bed and pick his team up ahead of their clash against the Foxes.

Tottenham moves up to eighth in the Premier League table in the race to cement their place in next season’s Champions League campaign. Tottenham are just six points off from the last Champions League spot after their game against the Clarets. With two goals and an assist, Gareth Bale will be the man who will be getting all the headlines.

For Jose Mourinho, it’s all smiles and laughter after the performance Spurs have put in. He prides on ending a game with a Win and Clean Sheet. That’s what his players have given him against Burnley. Jose Mourinho has been criticized for his recent results. It’s the first time since he’s lost 3 games in a row, but the performance against Burnley will be a result that he’ll be carrying along with him in his extraordinary career.

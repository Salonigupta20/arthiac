Mohamed Salah secured all 3 points for Liverpool as the Egyptian king netted his 100th Premier League goal in a historic night which was overshadowed by Harvey Elliot's horrific injury.

One of the Premier League's most fiery fixtures got underway at Elland Road.

The fans were buzzing as they welcomed their side to a standing ovation as they were set to pick their side up after their draw in the previous game.

Both managers are known for their intense approach and style of play, which has reaped rewards for their fans to savour and taste.

Raphinha found himself one on one with Robertson as he slid in a pass to Rodrigo, who stung the palms of Alisson as the game grew to life in the opening 5 minutes of the game.

Both sides kept pushing higher up the field as Leeds and Liverpool kept testing the defences of each other.

However, Mohamed Salah found the back of the net in the 20th minute of the game as he reached a century of Premier League goals as the Egyptian King converted a cross from Trent Alexander Arnold into a goal as he silenced the boos from the faithful at Elland Road.

A lot of credit has to go to Alexander Arnold as the right back found a sizzling pass on the feet of Salah as Liverpool looked to build on their advantage.

The Egyptian King joined an elite club as he became the 30th Premier League player to reach the hundred goal milestone as the Egyptian Magician took 162 appearances to reach the milestone.

The Reds turned on the heat as they stepped on the gas to put Marcelo Bielsa's back line on the back foot as Salah found an opening and fed in a cross for Thiago to head into the net, but VAR came into play as Salah was caught offside.

The hosts found it extremely difficult to relate to the agility and pace of "The Reds." Things kept getting worse for Marcelo Bielsa as the threat from Liverpool kept growing, which forced Liam Cooper and Diego Llorente to pick up yellow cards within the opening 30 minutes of the game.

Llorente's hamstrings caught up to him as he made way for Pascal Struijk to enter the frame on an overcast evening in west Yorkshire.

It is fair to say that Marcelo Bielsa got his tactics wrong against Jurgen Klopp's men as Leeds were getting pounded.

As the first half came to a close, Leeds finally had their guns loaded to threaten Liverpool, but Luke Ayling's rifle got jammed as he volleyed a cross from Jack Harrison right in front of goal over the bar.

The threat for Jurgen Klopp mostly was through Raphinha as the Brazilian winger kept Robertson on his toes and found himself open on multiple occasions to feed in a pass, but he couldn't find the key to unlock Liverpool's staggering defence.

Bielsa reinforced a half-time change which saw Tyler Roberts come in for Rodrigo, who took up the attacking position just behind Bamford.

The Reds found a clear cut chance in front of goal as Mane found himself through on goal, one-on-one with Meslier, as he scuffed his shot which fell kindly at the feet of Salah who scraped his chance as Struijk lunged into a goal-saving challenge which led to a corner for Liverpool.

The hosts conceded from a set-piece which was their main defensive concern last season as Fabinho made them pay as Leeds were not able to clear it away as Mane's blushes were cut out from the Brazilian defensive midfielder.

However, under Bielsa, the approach is always based on: "Where and when is the next goal coming."

Leeds kept pushing as they found themselves in good attacking positions, but they were never able to find the final touch to get one on the score sheet.

Unfortunately, Harvey Elliot was stretched off the field as Pascal Struijk lunged into a horrendous challenge on the 18-year old, who apparently seemed to have fractured/twisted his ankle, which ended the evening for the young lad. Players, coaches, and fans displayed their sympathy and best wishes to Harvey Elliot.

The game had gone cold after the incident occurred as the vibe around the stadium descended.

Daniel James made his second debut for Leeds as he came on in the 68th minute of the game as he was greeted by a warm reception from the home side.

With 20 minutes to go, the game started growing once again which saw Leeds cut through Liverpool's defence with Raphinha as the Brazilian couldn't get the weight on the pass for Bamford to slot it home.

Immediately, Liverpool counter-attacked and found themselves 3 on 3 against Leeds where Mane scuffed his opportunity once again in front of goal, courtesy of a delightful pass from Salah.

Mane once again found himself in front of goal as a challenge from the Leeds United defender got his shot away from goal. The night grew old for the Senegalese forward as he could've had a hattrick, but it just wasn't his night just yet.

Bamford tested Alisson's positioning in the game as he looped an attempt on goal, which saw Alisson tip the ball over the bar, which summarised what Leeds had lacked throughout the game as they failed to find their stride in front of goal.

Liverpool found their 3rd goal of the game which saw Sadio Mane get his 99th goal in Liverpool colours as he found the back of the net in the 92nd minute of the game as he drilled it past Meslier's left as it capped a slightly dented-perfect night out for Liverpool at Elland Road.

That goal just emptied a few seats at the stadium as Leeds fans were out to beat the traffic.

Liverpool climb up to 3rd in the table as they are set to be major contenders for the Premier League title.

We send our best wishes to Harvey Elliot for his speedy recovery.

## Liverpool Player Ratings

1.  Alisson - 8/10: The Brazilian rose to the occasion when put to the test as he kept Leeds at bay.

2.  TAA - 9/10: Found himself in multiple attacking positions in the game as he contributed immensely to Liverpool's attack on the right-hand side.

3.  Matip - 8/10: Showed a lot of positive signs in the defensive and attacking half of the pitch.

4.  Van Dijk - 8/10 : Kept the crosses of Raphinha and Harisson at bay while contributing to Liverpool's second goal.

5.  Robertson - 7/10: Caught on the blind side of Raphinha, the Scottish left-back didn't have to ruin his decision as Raphinha didn't make the most of his opportunities when he got the better of Roberston. Got into really good attacking positions in the second half.

6.  Fabinho - 9/10: After a day of being confirmed to play a part in GW4, Fabinho was in the zone as he netted Liverpool's second goal of the game, along with many defensive contributions in the game.

7.  Harvey Elliot - 6/10: Unfortunate scenes with the midfielder in the game as he struggled to find his feet earlier in the game.

8.  Thiago - 6/10: He thought he scored a goal, but Salah was caught offside during the buildup.

Overall, the Spanish midfielder didn't get into his groove during the game.

8.  Mane - 7/10: Scuffed many opportunities during the game as he could've put the game to bed. But, the effort put in has to be appreciated.
9.  Jota - 6/10: Never really settled into the game. Got into many attacking positions, but he was unfortunate not to get an assist to his name as Mane didn't capitalise on the opportunities provided.
10. Salah - 8/10 : The Egyptian magician got his goal and he could have got a few more attacking numbers to his game, but he contributed importantly with the opening goal on this historic day for him.

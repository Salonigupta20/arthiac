### 1. Thibaut Courtois: 8

The Belgian keeper was asked a few questions by the Granada boys as he kept Real Madrid's lead intact when the momentum was with the hosts.

Courtois made a huge save with a few minutes to go for half time when he denied a shot on target with the scoreline at 2-1. Late on in the game, in the second half, once again, Courtois came up with a big save to deny Jorge Molina. He couldn't do much with the equalising goal which was deflected into the net.

Throughout his Real Madrid career, Courtois has very rarely disappointed. He's made a lot of saves to keep Los Blancos in many games in the past. He deserves a lot of credit. Hoping that he continues to perform at such high standards for the remainder of the season.

### 2. Ferland Mendy: 7

The left back extremely dodgy in the first half. He wasn't confident on the ball and he poor in his supply and passing.

He needlessly gave the ball away many times and his decisions off the ball was something that caught the eyes of many as he made poor decisions.

However, it seems as though, Ancelotti spoke to well in the second half and the left back came out as a much prepared warrior to take on the challenge in front of him.

He made up for his defensive errors in the first half by adding a fourth to the score line in favour of Ancelotti and Real Madrid. Much to work on for Mendy, but has good character to give a fight.

### 3. David Alaba: 8

The Austrian is just growing in his role as a centre back. By now, he's already established himself well in the heart of Madrid's backline. He seems to have grown in confidence as a centreback since he scored the opening goal in the El Classico a few weeks ago.

He made multiple interceptions during the game as he read the game exceptionally well as he cut out the runs into the box from the hosts.

The progress that Alaba has made so far this season is just so good to see. It's been a good free coup acquired by Florentino Perez.

### 4. Nacho: 7

The centre-back came in to replace Eder Militao who was rested for this game. He made full use of his opportunity as he scored a goal for Madrid to bank on really well. He read the game well too and kept Granada's attackers at bay.

Sadly, he couldn't keep a clean sheet, but it's a performance that will remind and pressurise Ancelotti to find a place in the starting XI for his versatile defender.

Nacho had a point to prove with his critics suggesting that he wasn't ruthless while defending. Well, he's kept that quiet for now, but he's been an amazing servant for Real Madrid over the years. Hoping he gets his starts and plays regularly.

### 5. Dani Carvajal: 8.5

Carvajal has always been one of the few at Real Madrid who show great desire to work hard and reap rewards.

The Spaniard who was recently called back into the Spanish squad this November after an injury lay-off, seems to have grown in confidence over the last few weeks.

He headed into the international break by putting in an outstanding performance against Rayo Vallecano. Carvajal worked hard on and off the ball to keep his side out of danger. He was exceptional in his defensive duties. A real team man along with Nacho. He gets an added rating due to his work rate on the field.

Here are his stats:

- Total Tackles - 3
- Total Interceptions - 2
- Number of clearances - 7

### 6. Toni Kroos: 9.5

The retired German international was such a delight to watch at the Los Carmenes as he assisted the opening two goals for Real Madrid.

His second assist was a gem as he teamed up well with Luka Modric to set it up for Nacho.

Kroos is in really good form this season as he is contributing much more offensively and defensively as well. It is clear to see that his decision to retire from international football is paying huge dividends for Florentino Perez and Real Madrid as he is on another level with his performances. He looks a lot fresher and has the appetite to deliver time and time again. Just brilliant!

Here are his stats:

- Assists - 2
- Chances created - 6
- Big chances created - 2
- Passes completed - 73/74
- Long passes completed - 7/8
- Passing Accuracy - 97.3%

### 7. Casemiro: 7

Casemiro began this season way off the cards as he was unable to get things going for him. He was heavily criticised for his consistent performances, but he put them to rest for time being as he rolled back the years when he was in his prime.

He couldn't do much with the deflected goal, but the Brazilian put that behind him and read the game well since then as he was sharp with the ball at his feet. Another industrious performance from the man himself.

### 8. Luka Modric: 7

The veteran was once again sublime to the way Real Madrid progressed forward. At the age of 36, the Croatian has still managed to keep his fitness levels high and he is still performing at high standards.

If you look at it, it will be "just another day" in the office for the Croatian, but his work on and off the ball is still an art that is worth learning from. No wonder Mason Mount idolises Luka Modric.

Modric has always been unselfish and he made a blind run into the box as Benzema found him. Even though he had large chunks of the goal in front of him, he decided to lay it for Vini Jr. for a simple tap-in. He is a team man and he will be influential for Madrid's progress for the remainder of the season.

### 9. Marco Asensio: 7.5

There were a few rumours earlier in the summer that Asensio would be looking for game time rather than being on the bench at the Santiago Bernabeu as he had competition from Hazard, Bale and Rodrygo, but with injuries to Bale and with Hazard being out of favour for Ancelotti, Asensio has got a new lease of life in the whitr jersey.

The performance against Granada was very pleasing to see if you are a Real Madrid fan. He was on top of his game during his time on the pitch. The 25-year old rolled back the years at Los Carmenes which reminded us of when he burst onto the scene earlier in his career.

He scored the opening goal of the game where he capitalised on an error. That goal probably gave him added confidence as he caused a lot of chaos while he was on the attack. It seemed as though his role was a bit different in this game. It will be a matter of time to wait and see how Ancelotti uses Asensio as the season rolls on.

### 10. Karim Benzema: 6

The French striker didn't have a really good game by his high standards. Yet, he was pretty lively in the game and looked to link up well with his teammates.

He looked to create multiple opportunities for his teammates to score, but his delightful pass to Luka Modric opened up many doors for Real Madrid to score a third.

Even though he didn't have a good game in terms of goals and assists, the French striker was influential up top as his presence up top created spaces for Vini Jr. and Asensio to exploit.

At this point in time, it is fair to say that Benzema's duties with his national team are wearing on his shoulders.

### 11. Vinicius Junior: 7

The Brazilian began the game on a rusty note. He gave away the ball a few times and it was his error that gave Granada their goal.

However, he came out all guns blazing in the second half. He was back to his best where he ran riot at Granada's defensive line. He earned multiple fouls and got a player sent off as well. Had a bright grin on his face throughout the second half. Seems like Ancelotti instilled some knowledge into the youngster at half time.

He rounded off scoring the third goal for Real Madrid which was brilliant.

Here are his stats:

- Dribbles completed - 5
- Fouls drawn - 3
- Goals scored - 1

## Substitutes

### 12. Isco: 5

The midfielder will be disappointed as he is not getting regular playing minutes on the field. He had little time to make a difference in the game, but he kept the ball well as usual.

### 13. Camavinga: 4

The young Frenchman came on late in the game and just kept it simple in the middle of the park.

### 14. Jovic: 5

Yet another substitute appearance for the youngster. He is unable to get into the starting XI with Benzema in top notch form. He may be looking for minutes elsewhere in this upcoming winter transfer window.

### 15. Vallejo: N/A

The centre back didn't have much to do, although he recieved a standing ovation from the crowd at the Los Carmenes.

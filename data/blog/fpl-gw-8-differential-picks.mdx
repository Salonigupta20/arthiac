As an FPL manager, you must have been eagerly waiting for GW8 to commence as soon as possible, especially if you had a torrid time in GW7.

The average FPL points in GW7 was tallied at 38 while the highest belonged to fc druide who tripled captained Salah as he was miles ahead of those who averaged in and around 38 FPL points (or even lower).

This week, we'll give you our differential picks in all four positions of the FPL game.

### 1. Alex McCarthy (GK): £4.5m

The Southampton keeper has retained his starting spot in Ralph Hussenhutl's side after Fraser Forster gave him a good run for a starting spot in the Premier League towards the end of last season.

The Southampton goalie is priced at **£4.5m** and he is currently owned by **2.1%** of FPL managers as he has recorded **23 FPL points** with **2 clean sheets** so far this season against Man City and West Ham.

Southampton have a good run of fixtures coming their way starting from game week 8 to 12 where they take on Leeds, Burnley, Watford, Aston Villa and Norwich.

The FPL pounds you spend on McCarthy is a long term investment you can consider for the next few weeks.

Southampton take on Leeds in GW8 who may be without Raphinha (£6.5m) and Kalvin Phillips (£4.9m). Marcelo Bielsa will not be having the services of Bamford (£7.8m), Ayling (£4.4m) and Koch (£4.3m). The fixture against Leeds is an ideal fixture where the Saints have a higher probability of keeping a clean sheet.

There is one factor to consider though if you don't really look into an investment with Alex McCarthy.

- The Saints have got their Premier League season off to a pretty tough start as they faced Everton, Manchester United, West Ham, Manchester City and Chelsea.

  In those tough games, he has collected 4 save points as well. You can consider him as a reliable shot-stopper as well at £4.5m.

- Southampton may have used a defensive approach in their opening seven game weeks in this Premier League season.

However, against their opponents in the next 5 games, Ralph Hussenhutl will be on the hunt for a few wins which will expose the Saint's back line much more. That will probably reduce the chances of Southampton keeping a clean sheet, but at £4.5m, with the fixtures that are on the horizon, you could probably say that there are a few clean sheets coming their way and for you as well.

### 2. Kieran Tierney (DEF): £4.9m

The Scottish left back has been impressive since his arrival at Arsenal, although injuries have dented his progress throughout his time at Arsenal.

He is currently owned by **7.0%** of FPL managers worldwide as he has scored **23 FPL poin**ts. Arsenal have kept three clean sheets in the last four Premier League games.

Tierney has shown multiple glimpses of how threatening he could be from the right hand side of Arsenal's attack along with Bukayo Saka (£6.3m).

Arsenal have been able to keep two clean sheets in the last three Premier League games as they have been impressive against Burnley and Spurs. To some extent, Arsenal have been quite lucky against Brighton and Hove Albion where the Seagulls were unable to convery their chances in front of goal.

With Arsenal not competing in European competitions this season, you could expect them to be much more energetic and focused when they faces sides in the Premier League.

There is no doubt that their Premier League campaign got off to an awful start, but Mikel Arteta has been able to gel this side together.

The next six fixtures on the horizon for Arsenal are against Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Leicester, Watford, Liverpool and Newcastle.

Kieran Tierney can take immense confidence in the form and confidence that Aaron Ramsdale (£4.6m) has under his belt.

That will help the Gunners left back to be much more open and expressive when he surges forward.

It is about time that Tierney gets kn among the attacking returns for Arsenal in the upcoming gameweeks.

### 3. Riyad Mahrez (MID): £8.7m

The Algerian winger will be in **prime** contention to be a starter in the game against Burnley at the Etihad stadium.

He is currently owned by just **2.5%** of FPL managers worldwide. There is no other reason why the Algerian is owned by a few FPL managers due to Pep roulette. Here's why we highlighted the word "prime."

Riyad Mahrez has been slightly out of favour at the Etihad in recent weeks, but he still remains as an excellent pick for us at Arthiac just for this game week.

Mahrez comes into this fixture on the back of three goals and one assist on international duty.

Mahrez has a breathtaking record against Burnley as we take a look at how the Algerian has fared against Sean Dyche and his men over the last few seasons.

Riyad Mahrez has faced Burnley 13 times so far where six of them came in a Foxes shirt while the other seven came in the sky blue of Manchester City.

Mahrez scored his first goal in the Premier League against Burnley while he was at Leicester and the Clarets have been his favourite opponent in the Premier League.

Since he made his move to the Etihad in 2018, Mahrez has scored **seven goals** in **five appearances** while Pep Guardiola has taken charge.

His best outing against Burnley came last season in November when he scored a hattrick against them.

Heading into Saturday's game, the winger has scored six goals for City in his three Premier League home matches against Dyche's men, with the hosts cruising to 5-0 victories on each occasion.

The 30-year-old has never been benched for a home encounter against the Clarets.

The Algerian will be hoping he can make his mark once again for the Citizens this weekend.

Here's his record against Burnley:

- **Played** - 13
- **Goals** - 8
- **Assists** - 2

Considering taking a one week punt on the Algerian?

### 4. Kelechi Iheanacho (FOR): £7.0m

The foxes forward has been getting his opportunity to start with Brendan Rodgers implementing two forwards in his starting XI since game week 7.

We expect the Leicester manager to keep a similar line up for the majority of the Premier League season as Iheanacho delivered in his first start of the Premier League campaign with a goal and all three bonus points as Leicester were held at Selhurst Park after taking a two goal lead in the first half.

He is currently owned by just **2.4%** of FPL managers world wide. In the game prior to his first start against Burnley, he came on as a substitute and delivered an assist.

During the final phase of last season, Iheanacho was in the form of his life as he scored 11 goals and provided 2 assists in the final 12 games of the season.

He has teamed up really well with Jamie Vardy and he is set to link up extremely well as the season rumbles on.

It is fair to say that he is in serious contention for taking his place in the starting XI as he has proved Brendan Rodgers that he deserves a place in the playing 11. Adding to that, his side welcome Manchester United at the King Power stadium as he will take on a Man Utd side who will be without Harry Maguire (£5.4m) and Raphael Varane (£5.5m) which will mean that he will be able to cause havoc in Ole's defensive line which is predicted to have Victor Lindelof (£4.8m) and Eric Bailly (£4.9m) who are certainly not at their best.

Keep an eye on Leicester's fixtures from gameweek 8 to 17 as Leicester have a lot in their armoury to cause chaos to their opposition's defence.

If he nails his spot in the starting XI, you could get him in as he could open the door for you to squeeze in a premium asset in your FPL squad.

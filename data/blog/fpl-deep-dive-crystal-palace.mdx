There’s been a lot of travelling lately on the net, but this time we stay in London as we look at the club on the south-side of the capital. Crystal Palace is where we are headed to, as we take a dive into their FPL assets.

We look into every department that "The Eagles" have to offer for FPL managers around the world that would want to consider a potential opening for Palace asset (s) to enter their teams.

Crystal Palace have appointed a new manager, who is a former Arsenal captain. Three weeks ago, Crystal Palace named ex-Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira as their new manager, succeeding Roy Hodgson. Lucien Favre and Nuno Espirito Santo had been linked with the job in the week prior to the appointment of Patrick Viera.

Crystal Palace had hoped to choose a manager with Premier League experience, but with time running out and a number of players considering their future contracts, the club has lowered its standards to assist themselves in speeding up the hiring process. Patrick Vieira's work with Manchester City's development side has been recognised, and Crystal Palace say that the incoming manager will work closely with their academy.

Vieira was most recently the manager of Ligue 1 club Nice, when he took over in the summer of 2018 before being fired in December of the same year after a run of five defeats in all competitions, although he took Nice to a 7th place league finish in his first season in charge of his homeland club. The following season was halted due to the Pandemic, but as mentioned earlier, after a string of 5 consecutive defeats, his time was up as he was sacked.

It is without a doubt that Viera has taken up a job that will not be easy come the 13th of August. It will be a challenge that he has accepted whole-heartedly. With fingers crossed, fans will be hoping that Veira gets this Palace team up and running when the 2021-22 season starts.

## Crystal Palace in 2020-21

---

Crystal Palace played in the Premier League for the eighth straight season in 2020–21, extending their longest ever stay in the top flight of English football. Roy Hodgson truly deserves a lot of credit for keeping Crystal Palace in the Premier League during his time at Selhurst Park. Injuries kept piling up for "The Eagles", but Hodgson stuck to the personnel that he had at his disposal and secured their stay in the Premier League for yet another season.

Crystal Palace kicked off the Premier League season with a 1–0 home win over Southampton, with talisman Wilfried Zaha scoring his 50th Premier League goal. Crystal Palace were full of confidence as they defeated Manchester United 3–1, with Wilfred Zaha scoring twice against his previous club.

A few notable victories that Crystal Palace were able to achieve in the 2020-21 season were a 4-1 win over Leeds United, a thundering 5-1 victory against West Bromwich Albion and an entertaining 2-2 win against Aston Villa. Consequently, Crystal Palace have got a few results that they should be proud of, such as the 3-2 win and 0-0 draw against Manchester United, as well as the 1-1 draw against Spurs.

Sadly, Eberechi Eze, one of the star-men for "The Eagles", is out due to a serious achilles injury that could potentially keep him out for the rest of the 2021-22 season (provided that he responds well to the recovery process). His long-term injury has been a major dark cloud over those that belong to Selhurst Park.

## What to Expect from Crystal Palace in FPL?

---

Many FPL managers world-wide may ignore Crystal Palace to a large extent in search for other better fantasy assets from other clubs around the game. However, there are very few on this Crystal Palace side that FPL managers may consider during the course of an FPL season.

Having said that, the FPL assets available for Crystal Palace are worth consideration as they can make up for really good "differentials" as the 2021-22 season progresses.

During his time in New York City, he was recognized for his attractive style of play. Although, when he went to France and managed Nice, he had done them a fair few favours by providing them with European football, which is much more significant. At Palace, he has a tough job of understanding the players he has at his disposal and also applying his style of play in such a short time-span before the 2021-2022 Premier League season gets underway.

During his time at Nice, Lack of creativity, recruitment concerns as well as the failure to "identify" and "remain" with his finest and best team were some of the criticisms directed at him. There were also rumours that he had deserted the dressing room and that the fans were against him too during his stay as head coach at Nice.

## Players as Potential “Regular” Starters

---

### Goalkeepers

1.  **Guaita** - **£4.5m** - Vicente Guaita is a Spanish goalkeeper who is an impressive shot-stopper. He is one of the reliable sources for Crystal Palace in between the posts. He has pulled out multiple saves during his time at Crystal Palace.

    In the 2020-21 season, he was priced at £5.0m and took a price drop to be amongst a few budget goalkeepers that FPL managers may consider.

    His performance against Spurs in a 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park is certainly one of the best of his career in a Palace shirt.

    With defensive recruitments made by Crystal Palace in the transfer market, Vicente Guaita could be an investment that is worthy of a guaranteed 100+ FPL point season along with save points and bonus points.

### Defenders

1.  **Andersen** - **£4.5m** - Crystal Palace have secured the services of Joachim Andersen. The Danish centre-back is a much needed defensive personnel in the Crystal Palace back-line ahead of the 2021-22 Premier League season.

    He enters a back-line that has been relatively aging over the last few seasons. He is set to be one of the first names on the team sheet as he is a good, reliable centre-back by all accounts.

    Last season, he was in the Fulham side on loan who suffered through relegation back into the Championship. He was an enthralling figure in Fulham’s defence and was at the end of a few goal-scoring opportunities. Below are his stats in the Premier League.

    | Season <br /> Premier League | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ---------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2020-21                      | 31      | 1     | 1       |

    At Crystal Palace, he is sure to get a few more goals and assists to his name. He is a good, aggressive aerial defender who has an eye for goal every time he attacks set-pieces.

    **Our Opinion?** - Avoid for the first 10 gameweeks as they take many of the Premier League’s European candidates.

2.  **Kouyate** - **£4.5m** - Cheikhou Kouyate has been classified as a Defender this season as the former Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson used him as a centre-back for the entire 2020-21 Premier League season.

    He is an essential part of the Crystal Palace set up and has the ability to read the game pretty well. He also has the capability of making last-ditch tackles. He is a simple, old-fashioned centre-back and doesn’t attempt anything fancy while defending.

    Here are his stats:

    | Season <br /> Premier League | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ---------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2018-19                      | 31      | 0     | 2       |
    | 2019-20                      | 35      | 1     | 1       |
    | 2020-21                      | 36      | 1     | 0       |

    **Our Opinion?** - Avoid.

3.  **Mitchell** - **Left-back** - **£4.5m** - Tyrick Mitchell is a left-back who is capable of providing points up and down the field.

    Defensively, he makes up for lost ground quickly and is content to put a block in from the crosses that arrive at his end. He shows a tremendous work ethic as he is relatively young with a lot of playing days ahead of him.

    From an attacking perspective, he gets really close to the opposition’s penalty box and finds a progressive pass or two. He is physically sound as well and can burst through an attack with his pace.

    Last season, he scored the winning goal against Aston Villa to secure a comeback win for the Eagles, and he will be under enormous expectations from fans and his manager to deliver much better stats and performances to help Crystal Palace in the foreseeable future.

    He will be a regular starter at Palace considering the kind of play that Viera will look to implement in this team.

    **Our Opinion?** - Avoid or use him as a bench option.

### Midfielders

1.  **Zaha** - **£7.0m** - Wilfred Zaha is undeniably the talisman of this Crystal Palace side for many years. He is the heart and soul of Crystal Palace when they are on the attack. It is fair to say that Crystal Palace have been extremely dependent on him over many seasons for his goals, assists and attacking prowess.

    He shows a good work ethic when he is on the attack. Patrick Viera might have to find a way to deal with him when it comes to Zaha’s attitude and character on the field.

    Zaha’s numbers have been relatively good considering that he doesn’t take penalties often, as well as the fact that he plays for (with all due respect) an average Premier League side.

    Here are his stats:

    | Season <br /> Premier League | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ---------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2014-15                      | 31      | 4     | 2       |
    | 2015-16                      | 34      | 2     | 1       |
    | 2016-17                      | 35      | 7     | 9       |
    | 2017-18                      | 29      | 9     | 3       |
    | 2018-19                      | 34      | 10    | 5       |
    | 2019-20                      | 38      | 4     | 3       |
    | 2020-21                      | 30      | 11    | 2       |

    **Our Opinion?** - Zaha has always been an FPL asset that will score goals and give you signs that he is on a roll. But, that goal-scoring form is not consistent as he goes on a goal-drought for a while and then scores for 2-3 weeks followed by another goal-scoring drought.

    Make sure you catch his train before it derails!

2.  **Eze** - **£6.0m** - It is still not known when Eberehi Eze will return from his Achilles injury. Depending on the positive news of his return, we will put up a separate article on his influence on the side.

### Forwards

1.  **Benteke** - **£6.5m** - Christian Benteke arguably remains as the go-to centre-forward for Crystal Palace in front of goal. His goals at different stages of the game have given Crystal Palace a new lease of life when the game is almost out of reach for the Eagles.

    Last season, against Brighton, the game was completely dominated by "The Seagulls." Brighton had 25 shots at goal but failed to convert them. By the end of stoppage time, in the 95th minute, Christian Benteke sealed all 3 points for Crystal Palace, which brought about a huge smile from Roy Hodgson.

    He has a thundering header in him along with some serious physical attributes that make him extremely lethal in front of goal. Below are his stats:

    | Season <br /> Premier League | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ---------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2016-17                      | 36      | 15    | 2       |
    | 2017-18                      | 31      | 3     | 5       |
    | 2018-19                      | 16      | 1     | 1       |
    | 2019-20                      | 24      | 2     | 1       |
    | 2020-21                      | 30      | 10    | 1       |

    **Our Opinion?** - He could get many goal-scoring opportunities if Crystal Palace had players with creativity in their side. Their lack of creativity will limit Benteke’s chances of scoring more goals for the club. Avoid.

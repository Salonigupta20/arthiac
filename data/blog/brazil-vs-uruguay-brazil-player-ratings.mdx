Brazil set sail on their winning ways once again as they hammered Uruguay 4-1 in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers at the Amazonia Arena.

Star boy Neymar claimed his 70th goal in Brazilian colours as he opened the scoring for the Selecao in the 10th minute which was followed by a goal from Raphinha in the 18th minute.

The Brazilians got off to a flying start as they kept the ball rolling in and around the penalty box which caused a lot of issues for the Celestes.

The Uruguayans looked to calm the Brazilian storm with their defensive approach towards the remainder of the game as they had set sight to breach Ederson, but Raphinha came along once again as he rounded off a sensational counter-attacking goal as he tapped the ball into the back of the net from Neymar's spicy cross.

Uruguay needed a miracle to come back in the game as they found a glimmer of hope when Luis Suarez slotted a free kick into the back of the net well beyond Ederson's reach.

However, Gabriel Barbosa sliced out that glimmer of Uruguayan hope as he scored the fourth goal of the night where Neymar had played a role in there too.

Last week, Brazil drew against Colombia but this win will be a huge morale booster for them especially for the Leeds forward, Raphinha.

With 7 qualifying games to go in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers, Brazil are set to go through comfortably to Qatar. Here are the player ratings:

### 1. Ederson: 6.5

The Man City keeper didn't have much to do in goal, but he was asked a few simple questions when Uruguay were looking to get back into the game.

However, he was well beaten by Suarez's free kick as he couldn't make a save in what would be a perfect night for the Selecao.

### 2. Alex Sandro: 7.5

The Juve left back was looking to be a constant menace to Uruguay down the left-hand side, but he was unable to provide those elite services.

However, he still had a good night in the office as he had made good tackles to prevent Uruguay from pushing forward.

### 3. Thiago Silva: 7.5

The veteran defender was still at the top of his game as he was really good in the air and he got himself a 98.1% pass accuracy.

Uruguay couldn't test his pace as his performance was yet another display of how good a leader he is as he marshalled the backline really well for Selecao.

### 4. Verissimo: 7.5

He was led by Thiago Silva really well as his night was one to remember as he linked up really well with his defensive line.

He read the game well, made a few good interceptions and found a pass to keep Brazil moving forward.

He should and will be proud of his performance against a top side in Uruguay.

### 5. Emerson Royal: 6.5

It was a balancing act for the Spurs right back as he pushed forward at times and held himself back as well to protect and guard his defender's.

He had a decent and productive night out. He should be pleased.

### 6. Fred 7.5

In terms of numbers, Fred had 93.2% of his passes completed in the game along with an assist for Neymar for the first goal.

He kept and supplied the ball well and even snatched the ball a few times to keep his side on the front foot.

### 7. Fabinho: 6.5

The defensive midfielder did a lot of dirty work as he mopped up a lot of the Uruguayan attack.

He had a good game until he picked up a yellow card for a reckless foul. Well, we guess that was a but too dirty from the Liverpool midfielder.

### 8. Raphinha: 8.5

The Leeds United midfielder had a "perfect" night in his first start in Brazilian colours as he scored two really good goals.

He linked up really well with his forward players, in particular with Neymar.

He showed what he is capable of with a few silky runs as he danced his way into the box more often than not.

The Selecao fans will be hoping that he produces more of the same in the years to come.

### 9. Lucas Paqueta: 7

His constant pace and clever runs into the box caused a lot of chaos in the Uruguayan defence.

He linked up really well with Raphinha, Neymar and Jesus in the game and found himself in really good goal scoring positions in the game.

He was unlucky not to get a goal, but he made his contribution count in the second goal for the Selecao.

### 10. Gabriel Jesus: 7

Along with Paqueta, Jesus provided a threat from the right flank and really asked a lot of questions for Uruguay to answer defensively.

He would be disappointed not to get on the score line, but it's a night where he will know that he linked up really well with Neymar and Paqueta to keep things flowing in the final third of Brazil's attacking play.

### 11. Neymar: 9

It was yet another day in the glamorous office for Neymar Jr. as he was ever present in all that Brazil had created in front of goal.

In terms of numbers, he scored once and assisted twice in the game with his assist to Raphinha the best out of the bunch.

Well, he could've had more as he had missed a few chances and found himself offside on a number of occasions, but it will be a night for him to be satisfied and proud of.

## Substitutes

### 12. Gabriel Barbosa: 8

He came on as a substitute for Jesus just after the hour mark and came up with the fourth goal of the game as he was deemed onside.

A comfortable night for the forward.

### 13. Douglas Luiz: 5.5

He came on for Fabinho as he looked to keep the Selecao midfield stable.

He wasn't able to make a huge impact in the game.

### 14. Antony: 6

Antony came along and put on an impressive display on the field as he created two chances.

He is bound to get into the starting XI in the coming month and he will be pushing for it once again after two really good cameo performances.

### 15. Everton Ribeiro: 5

He came on as a replacement for Raphinha, but he couldn't match the brilliance and quality that Raphinha was able to provide in the game.

He lacked flair and precision and was almost out of the picture for most of his time on the pitch.

### 16. Edenilson 3

Came on the field with barely two minutes left on the clock. Kept looking to assist his team forward in the game.

If there was only one transfer that circulated all across the white side of Madrid, it was that of Kylian Mbappe and the staggering price tag that PSG had put on him.

Nevertheless, Florentino Perez has gone elsewhere in the market to bolster his side in midfield with the signing of the 18-year old from Rennes for a â‚¬31 million fee plus add-ons.

It was reported that Real Madrid had submitted an official bid to Rennes on Sunday afternoon, which was officially accepted during the late hours of Monday night.

Camavinga's transfer speculation grew last summer as the young starlet was looking for a move away from the French club, as reports suggested that his dream club that he would like to play for would be Los Blancos. With the summer transfer window of 2021 peaking all expectations, Real Madrid settled their interest in the French youngster as they had fixed their gaze on Mbappe's mega-money signing from PSG.

During the summer transfer window, Manchester United and PSG showed great interest in the player themselves, but they never placed an official bid on the table for Rennes to consider. Reports grew midway through the summer that Manchester United were about to place an offer for Camavinga, but, as usual, their interests in the player took a backward step for the time-being. PSG were also in the hunt as they had shown interest, but never took the initiative to sign the player.

After months and weeks, Perez suddenly decided to pull the trigger on the signing and he has once again got his man.

According to reports, Camavinga preferred to stay at Rennes and not renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2022. Consequently, he also preferred to wait for Real Madrid's call either in January (as a pre-agreement signing) or in the summer transfer window of 2022. The player and his agent did not see this coming, especially with the transfer deadline approaching closer than ever, but Los Blancos demonstrated their interest in signing him immediately and the teenager didn't hesitate to accept the proposal.

As Fabrizio Romano mentioned on his twitter handle, "Camavinga chose Real Madrid over PSG and Manchester United."

The Frenchman completed his medical just hours ago and he is set to be unveiled as a Real Madrid player. His paperwork is signed and sealed and he is going to be a part of Ancelotti's 25-man squad this season. Perez doesn't intend to send him out on loan as he considers the player as a key part of the project that he has in store for now and for years to come.

After going 2 years without spending a penny on the market, Real Madrid have finally spent a part of their overall stash on a new midfielder. The last player that Los Blancos spent on was Reinier, who is currently on loan at Borussia Dortmund.

Well, Ancelotti has got his wish as he wanted to sign a new midfielder and he will be delighted to add the French starlet to his squad after injuries to ageing players such as Modric and Kroos have kept them out of the start of the new campaign.

The fans will be extremely delighted with the signing of Camavinga as they can live with high hopes and expectations once again as the season kicks into new gear after the international break.

His addition to the squad will be a huge boost to Real Madrid, who have lacked creativity and gaile in midfield to unlock teams that are tight at the back. His energy, drop of the shoulder and crisp passing will just make Real Madrid tick time and time again, which will also provide Ancelotti with what he requires when his team plays, i.e., higher intensity throughout the 90 minutes.

This will enable Casemiro to focus solely on the defensive aspects of his game and contribute immensely to the back-line of Real Madrid, which looks fragile with the departure of Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane in the same window this summer.

## Was this a strategic move by Perez to win back the trust of his fans?

Hmm, you could debate it, but we prefer to keep the lid closed on that topic. In fact, we don't think that Florentino Perez should be criticised even though it was a strategic move to sign Eduardo Camavinga.

In the past, all the elite clubs around Real Madrid across the globe have been consistently spending on players in the summer as well as in the January transfer market, but Real Madrid have been quiet for a while.

When Real Madrid won 3 Champions Leagues in a row, they didn't spend a dime on transfers for 3 years running. Eventually, they broke the bank on Eden Hazard, who hasn't really made an impact so far during his stay in the Spanish capital.

Two years have rolled by and the head of Real Madrid, Mr. Florentino Perez, has decided to spend once again in the market securing the services of quality, top-notch players, which would add to his overall legacy of finding gems and superstars during his time at the helm of Real Madrid.

Even though he has a negative side to himself which people may not appreciate, the faithful fans of Los Blancos can not afford to turn against him as he has consistently delivered for the benefit of the club.

It may be strategic for Perez to calm the tension around the Santiago Bernabeu, but we see no issues with that as Real Madrid are set to be a big player once again in the world of football.

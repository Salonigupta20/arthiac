### 1. Pickford: 6.5

Made a really good save early on in the game. He made a few really good saves in the game and kept Everton in the game as much as he could, but he was convincingly beaten by Ogbonna's header.

### 2. Seamus Coleman: 6.5

The Irish defender was really good throughout the game. Couldn't offer much up front, but he did well to keep Benrahma quiet down the flanks.

### 3. Ben Godfrey: 5.5

The versatile defender was beaten well by Angelo Ogbonna in the air. He struggled to keep the back line tight and was rusty in possession of the ball.

### 4. Michael Keane: 6.5

The defender did really well to contain the aggression and girth of Antonio in the air and on the floor.

He made a really good clearance off the Jamaican striker's effort on goal.

### 5. Digne: 6

He struggled to get Everton up the pitch. The movements of his teammates didn't help him to progress forward.

### 6. Allan: 5

As always, his work was to cut out opponents, sweep up and clear the lines.

Made a few good interceptions of the ball on its way to Antonio.

### 7. Doucoure: 6

The midfielder was slightly impressive after he displayed yet another performance of being in and around the edge of the penalty box.

### 8. Andros Townsend: 6.5

He looked to push forward with real intent and he also put in some really good deliveries in the box.

A few of those deliveries did not concern the West Ham defender's much, but a few of them really put the Hammers on alert.

### 9. Alex Iwobi: 4

The attacking midfielder had a poor day on the field as he failed miserably to make any impact in the game.

He was lucky to be on the pitch for 78 minutes.

### 10. Demarai Gray: 6.5

The young attacker always looked for solutions and ways to cause chaos to the West Ham defence.

He has immense drive and hunger to run down at opposition defences.

### 11. Rondon: 4.5

The striker had a very quiet afternoon. He couldn't make a difference in the game and Benitez will certainly be reaping his benefits in the cup competitions itself.

## Substitutes

### 12. Anthony Gordon: 5.5

Came on with 12 minutes left on the clock and he couldn't inspire an Everton comeback.

## West Ham

---

### 1. Lucasz Fabianksi: 6

He had a comfortable afternoon as the men in front of him did all the required work.

A few efforts on goal were thrown at him, but the Pole dealt with it comfortably.

### 2. Ben Johnson: 5.5

The young right back had his work cut out mostly defensively.

He couldn't offer much upfront like his teammate, Vladimir Coufal.

### 3. Kurt Zouma: 6.5

The French defender was yet again impressive winning most of his aerial duels and covered up well on the floor.

### 4. Angelo Ogbonna: 8.5

The Italian defender had one of his best games in the Premier League so far. A goal and a clean sheet for him to reminisce on.

Ogbonna came up with multiple interceptions and was really good in the air.

### 5. Aaron Cresswell: 6.5

Not the best night for the left back while pushing forward, but showed character to still find an opening. He was really good in defence.

### 6. Declan Rice: 7.5

A few days after having a slightly off day while he was on international duty with England, Rice has bounced back and showed us why he is still regarded as one of the best defensive midfielders available right now.

It was a performance to be noted by all the suitors who want to invest in him in the near future.

### 7. Tomas Soucek: 6.5

Scored a goal, but was ruled out for offside. Partnered along well with Rice and kept the Hammers pushing forward.

### 8. Jarrod Bowen: 6.5

He provided the assist for the only goal of the game.

He provided a good attacking threat for the Hammers and ran really well in behind the lines.

### 9. Said Benrahma: 5.5

Built up play really well for the Hammers, but he couldn't really make a big impact in front of goal.

He had a disappointing afternoon by his standards, but he will come out well in a few days time.

### 10. Pablo Fornals: 6

The Spaniard was an ever-present source of energy in midfield for West Ham. He came close to scoring, but he couldn't find the net.

### 11. Michail Antonio: 5.5

A surprisingly very quiet afternoon for the striker especially given the form that he is in this season.

Worked hard on and off the ball, but he failed to create a few chances. Got booked for a silly dive.

## Substitutes

### 12. Craig Dawson: 6

Came on and did well to contain the Everton attack.

### 13. Manuel Lanzini: N/A

Came on with just 3 minutes left on the clock. Couldn't make an impact in the game.

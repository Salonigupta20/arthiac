It is fair to say that La Liga has lost its global reputation with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi leaving. Saul Niguez is also reportedly looking for a move away from Atletico Madrid, but so far, there's not been much development happening in and around his transfer saga.

But, there is always something to look up to in a league and the teams that compete for the title.

The results are set to be much more enthralling while teams fancy their chances to a greater height as they set out on the field with much more ambition and hope.

Of course, if you are at the stadium supporting your team, we're sure that you'll be cranking up a bit more as your voice will be heard throughout the 90 minutes of a football game.

With all due respect, if you are a supporter of the underdogs in the league, then you must be high on hopes for your side to finish higher up the table by the end of the season as the big boys have lost their big guns.

Well, for now, let's keep all this transfer news away for a while. What happens on the pitch, stays on the pitch and that's exactly where we are headed to in this article.

Last night, if you tuned in to watch Levante take on Real Madrid at the Estadio Ciudad de Valencia, then you were in for a treat, especially if you tuned in during the 2nd half of the game.

(Side note: I hope you packed yourself with chips and drinks during the 2nd half.) The 2nd half was just all about "quality." But, of course, we shouldn't ignore the way the game panned out in the 1st half.

At the Estadio Ciudad de Valencia, 40% of fans were allowed to enter the stadium, which was approximately nearly 10,000 spectators.

(They had their chips and drinks with them by the time they reached home.)

Carlo Ancelotti deployed and played with their standard 4-3-3 formation with the undisputed Courtois in goal, Lucas Vasquez at right-back, Militao and Nacho at centre-back and new signing David Alaba at left-back.

In midfield, there was a South American pairing of Fede Valverde and Casemiro who would do all the hard yards, giving the Spaniard, Isco, the license to roam around and stretch out defences.

In Attack, it was the big boys for Los Blancos as Hazard, Benzema, and Bale all started together.

Real Madrid took the lead within the first 5 minutes of the game through a cool, calm and collective finish from the Welshman-Gareth Bale, which saw Real Madrid cut through Levante's defence as Big Benz cut inside and found his teammate.

Real Madrid were still being put under pressure when Levante pressed forward and attacked with intent. You could say that the home side were just shifting a few gears before they really got into action.

Los Blancos were able to find pockets of space in midfield, but never really caused much threat to their opponents of scoring a goal.

The credit for that goes to the boys in blue and red as they cut out any further opportunities that Real Madrid looked to capitalise on.

Fede Valverde, David Alaba and Bale tried to catch the goalkeeper on his toes and attempted a few reasonable long-range shots which didn't bother Aitor Fernandez in goal for Levante.

Isco and Benzema came quite close to finding the second goal, but they were unable to find the net by the end of the first half.

Seconds into the second half, Levante found a pass through to Roger Marti, who drilled it in low past Courtois as the ball trickled its way over the line to give the home side a much deserved lead. The Belgian shot-stopper couldn't keep Roger at bay even though he got a good strong hand on it. Unfortunately, the ball won the race before Vasquez tried to deny the equaliser for Levante.

Levante kept pushing Real Madrid back as they continued to attack after gaining loads of confidence as they found the equaliser.

But, there were two stunning moments in this game and Campana deserves a lot of credit for his goal, as he sees the cross come in early, sets himself up and connects ever so sweetly right at the roof of the net as the home crowd roared with delight at what they had just seen. Courtois had to just admire the beauty of that finish.

That was a spectacular goal from the midfielder as he wasted no time in savouring every moment with the fans.

Carlo Ancelotti started rolling the dice as he brought on the feisty hot Brazilian winger-Vinicius Junior from the bench to replace Eden Hazard, who was way below his usual high standards.

This was when Los Blancos started tearing up the left hand side of their attack as Vini Junior was ready to take on defenders with his immaculate pace and skill.

Dani Carvajal and Rodrygo joined in an attack from the opposite flank to threaten Levante with conceding an equalizer. Those boys in white turned up the heat, in particular, Vinicius Junior, as he found the back of the net in the 73rd minute after he beat his counterpart for pace and scored a silky left-footed goal past the goalkeeper.

But, the drama didn't stop there as Levante found their 3rd goal of the game as the ball ricocheted kindly off the Austrian-David Alaba and fell at the feet of Rover Pier in the 79th minute of the game as Levante restored their 1-goal lead.

Ancelotti was seen upset as he took his seat in the dug-out as the Granotes-The Frogs leaped to joy by scoring the 3rd goal.

The home side could have made it 4-2 in favour of the Granotes, as the shot from substitute Alejandro Cantero hit the outside of the post, which saw Courtois scrambling within the penalty box, which kept the score line at 3-2 in favour of the home side.

Real Madrid kept pushing for their 3rd goal as a cross from Rodrygo was met by a header from Luka Jovic who timed it sweetly, but Aitor Fernandez pulled out an amazing save in the 83rd minute of the game, which was followed up by Carvajal as he looked to smash the rebound into the net as this still saw the home side take all 3 points from Los Blancos.

The DNA within Real Madrid is to "Never. Give. Up" and they showed that they never do as they found the equaliser in the 85th minute of the game after a splendid assist from Benzema which brought about a sensational goal from Vinicius as he found the back of the net from a very tight angle, which left the Granotes goalkeeper in awe of what he had just seen.

Real Madrid had the opportunity to seal the deal with Levante's goalkeeper, Aitor Fernandez, seeing a straight red card after he came out of the penalty box and used his hands, which denied Rodrygo a clear-cut goal-scoring opportunity.

But the men in white were not able to steal all three points and had to settle for an entertaining 3-3 draw at the Estadio Ciudad de Valencia.

This result will not please the Italian boss, who is in the hot seat on the white side of Madrid, who has expressed his disappointment at Real Madrid's defending in the second half of the game.

Earlier, Ancelotti had stated that he was working along with Vini Junior to improve his finishing abilities in front of goal by taking one or two touches and finding the back of the net. As a result, the Brazilian did not disappoint as his work on the training pitch was rewarded with 2 amazing goals that saved Real Madrid from defeat.

Next, Real Madrid travel to Seville to face Real Betis, which is another extremely tough fixture for the men in white to contend with.

Ancelotti and his boys will know what is at stake as they need to roll up their socks and keep the pace in order to catch their close rivals Atletico Madrid and FC Barcelona for the 2021-22 La Liga title.

Meanwhile, we travel across southern Europe to look at how things are playing out in Italy. The Old Lady has just signed Manuel Locatelli from Sassuolo for a reported fee of 35m.

The Euro 2020 winner has penned a deal with Juventus where the Old Lady will tie him down on loan for two years with an obligation to buy, including add-ons. The Bianconeri have offered a contract up to June 2026. Well, only time will tell if we will see Locatelli back in Turin in the black and white jersey.

The 23-year-old began his career at AC Milan before moving on loan to Sassuolo in 2018 before joining them permanently a year later.

The Leece-born star helped Milan win the Italian SuperCoppa in 2016. Things went pretty downhill from there on, which earned him a move to Sassuolo, which was initially a loan for a year until the Neroverdi signed him permanently.

Last season, the midfielder scored 4 goals and provided 2 assists in 34 Serie A appearances, which are not bad numbers for a midfielder who pulled the strings at the heart of Sassuolo’s attacking prowess.

At 23 years of age, he has made 15 appearances for the Italian National Team and has scored 3 goals.

But, his impressive performances for Italy in the Euros have sealed his dream move to the club that he had intended to play for, even as Arsenal kept tempting him from the northern side of Europe.

"Manuel is an absolute quality and security in midfield, bringing a level of class that few have. The giant steps he has taken in the top flight, following stints with Atalanta and Milan's youth teams, only confirms this, "Juventus issued a statement.

Juventus will be hoping that he makes an instant impact and brings creativity to the heart of Juve’s midfield, which will help and assist the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Alvaro Morata up front.

But....

## Is he the man to earn the Trust of the Old Lady?

Over the years, Juventus have struggled to find the ideal player that they would like to have at the centre of the park. In the past, the likes of Miralem Pjanic, Aruro Vidal and Paul Pogba have been at the centre of it all in terms of creativity.

Since the departures of those notable creative midfielders, Juve have struggled to get a player or two that would fulfill that role.

Some may argue that the lack of a creative midfielder was a part of the reason why Juve struggled last season in the league as they narrowly escaped playing in the Europa League.

At 23 years of age, Locatelli has a lot to offer and there is a lot of prospect for this young gun to excel and be among the main talking points within the ranks at Juventus.

At the Euro’s, Locatelli discord twice in a 3-0 win against Switzerland, which was the starting point at which he started drawing attention from Arsenal and Juventus.

We all need Lady Luck at times, and Juve has got it with the signing of the Leece-born midfielder.

## Can he Cope up with the Demands at Juve?

He definitely can! When he was brought on to the Italian National Team set-up, not many of us knew the quality and the calibre that he had within him.

As usual, with the Italian national team, the focus and the spotlight are always on the likes of Ciro Immobile, Lorenzo Insigne, Bonucci, Chiellini, Jorginho, and Donnarumma. But, since Locatelli scored two goals for Italy against Switzerland, his image and people’s perception of him as a player for club and country have taken a huge spike.

Manuel Locatelli made headlines in Italy's 3-0 win over Switzerland in a Group A European Championship game at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Locatelli scored twice in each half to help Italy become the first team to advance to the competition's round of 16 stage.

When he was replaced in the 86th minute, the home crowd gave him a standing ovation.

If the guy can cope with pressure on the national stage at a very young age, then there is no doubt that he will succeed as a player in the bianconeri jersey.

Yes, we agree that he will have a lot of responsibilities on his shoulder as the fans will expect a lot more from him and they will expect him to be a regular supplier to the men upfront.

Some of us may even debate the fact that he succeeded so early in his national team career because Italy was "a family" throughout the entire course of the European Championships.

Well, Juve are not far behind either as a family.

The likes of Chiellini and Bonucci are more than enough to build and secure a positive working environment and provide the love, care and affection that the player might need as adrenaline to boost their performances on the field.

Watch him get on a roll this season!

### Cristiano Ronaldo seals his 10th international career hat-trick as Portugal scourges Luxembourg.

Portugal hunts down Luxembourg at the Estadio Do Algarve as Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 10th international hat-trick on a night where he has distanced himself from the rest in the all time International goal scoring charts.

Portugal sit in second place in group A as they are just a point behind Serbia, with a game in hand in the race to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

### Rui Patricio: 6

He had a rather comfortable night in between the posts, but was tested in the second half and dealt with the situation well.

He made a few misplaced long passes in the game, but made it up for a decent save off Rodrigues.

### Nuno Mendes: 6.5

The young left-back struggled to get on with the game in the opening 45 minutes of the game and received an early yellow card., but he got into really good positions in the second half and nearly got an assist as he found Bruno Fernandes.

He continued to surge forward with real intent and finesse.

### Pepe: 7.5

The veteran was a key figure as always in the defensive organisation of the Portuguese defensive line.

He also emerged from the back on a few occasions and led the attack for a brief period of time. He also won multiple aerial duels.

Kept a clean sheet.

### Ruben Dias: 7

The Man City centre back had a decent night in defence as his aerial ability was put to the test, but the young Portuguese defender rose up to the challenge.

He even had a really good chance on goal through set-pieces, but he headed it straight into the hands of the Luxembourg keeper.

Partnered along with his veteran defender and kept a clean sheet.

### Joao Cancelo: 6

The Man City right back found it difficult to make an impact in this game. He even booked in the final 10 minutes of the game. Looked rusty and off his usual best.

Won his side a free kick at the end of the game.

### Joao Moutinho: 6.5

The Wolves midfielder kept things nice and simple in the middle of the park as he pulled the threads for Portugal in the middle of the park.

Yet another dependable performance from the veteran.

### Palhinha: 7.5

The defensive midfielder produced yet another display of grit and determination in the middle of the park as he covered the back four with ease for most portions of the game.

He delivered the fourth goal for Portugal as he rose up well and guided down the header into the back of the net. Pulled out a cheeky Cristiano Ronaldo "Siuuuu" celebration as well.

### Bruno Fernandes: 8

The Man Utd midfielder was brilliant with the ball on his feet yet again as he scored the third goal for Portugal in the first half and provided an assist for Portugal's fourth.

As usual, he was a bit grumpy and lunged into a few mis-timed tackles, but he escaped without a booking.

### Andre Silva: 6

A rather cold night for the RB Leipzig striker as he couldn't make an impact in the game.

He also struggled to link up well with Bernardo Silva and Ronaldo on his right and left hand side. He will be looking to make amends in his threat up front for Portugal by next month.

### Bernardo Silva: 7.5

The Man City midfielder was ever present in the right-wing position for Portugal as he danced his way into the penalty box and earned a penalty.

Found himself on a lot of set-piece duties and succeeded more often than not.

He was lively and made the Luxembourg defence question their decision to intercept the Portuguese.

Yet another fine day in the office for Bernardo Silva as he just keeps growing from strength to strength.

### Cristiano Ronaldo: 9.5

We are clearly running out of superlatives for this icon and legend of the game. Clearly the best player on the field.

He has once again shown his desire and commitment to score goals even at the age of 36.

CR7 opened the scoreline with a penalty as he smashed it right down the middle of the net.

Two minutes later, he earned himself yet another penalty and converted it twice after his first attempt in the second penalty kick was ruled out for encroachment from a Portuguese player.

The Man Utd superstar had an attempt at the end of the first half, but the Luxembourg keeper, Anthony Moris came up with a save.

In the second half, once again Ronaldo found himself in front of goal from a delightful low cross from Nuno Mendes, but the superstar couldn't direct his attempt on goal.

In the 68th minute of proceedings, Ronaldo controlled a stinging cross from Joao Cancelo into the box and while the ball was still airborne, the five time Ballon D'or winner attempted a sizzling overhead kick that looked destined to ripple the net, but once again, Anthony Moris denied the Portuguese superstar.

Well, Cristiano Ronaldo refused to be downcast as he still looked for another goal to take the match ball home.

There was no doubt that he wouldn't take the match-ball home as he headed the ball into the back of the net following a cross from Ruben Neves.

The goal was checked by VAR and CR7 was deemed onside. The joy and sign of relief on his face told the story that this fairytale isn't coming to an end soon.

He clearly has much bigger objectives on his agenda as his international goal tally stands at 115 as he sees himself clearly at the top of the charts.

To add to that record, Ronaldo scored his 10th international hat-trick as he headed Portugal's fifth goal into the back of the net.

The boy from Madeira isn't done yet!

## Substitutes

### Joao Mario: 5

He was brought on to add fresh legs in the middle of the park and add more attacking prowess in Portugal's attacking play, but he failed to contribute.

When he got into a forward position, he misplaced a few of his passes which killed the Portuguese attack. Did most of his work in the centre of the park.

### Ruben Neves: 7.5

Came on and had one effort on goal from range as he continued his search for his first goal in Portuguese colours.

However, he deserves a lot of credit for supplying a fine classy assist for Ronaldo's 58th career hattrick.

### Rafael Leao: 6

Made his first competitive debut for Portugal with just over 15 minutes left on the clock.

He loves taking on defenders and gave us an insight into that late on in the second half.

### Goncalo Guedes: 6

Came on and nearly found Ronaldo within a few seconds of his introduction.

Made a few bursting runs in behind the Luxembourg defence.

### Matheus Nunes: 5

The midfielder made his international debut and did pretty well sweeping up and keeping his side on the front foot.

## Netherlands player ratings

1.  **Justin Bijlow: 6.5** - It was just a relatively small 90 minute picnic for the Dutch goalkeeper. Didn't have to make a save in the game.
2.  **Daley Blind: 7** - He is one of the most experienced members of this Dutch side and he did really well to keep the ball and kept it moving regularly, testing the Gibraltar defensive line constantly.
3.  **Virgil Van Dijk: 8** - The Dutch centre-back got Liverpool off to a flying start as he scored from a corner.

    He also had a comfortable night out with not much being thrown at him from the Gibraltar offensive line.

4.  **Stefan de Vrij: 7** - While the others were looking to push forward and pile on the pressure, the Inter Milan defender held himself back and kept things easy. He was cool, calm and collected throughout the game.
5.  **Denzel Dumfries: 7** - This young lad is going from strength to strength as he put on a much better performance against Gibraltar.

    His pace and drive on the right flank will be crucial for Netherlands. He also scored the fourth goal.

6.  **Klaassen: 7** - Once again, he had real authority in all that he did at the heart of the Dutch midfield.

    Ultimately, he got himself an assist for the second goal.

7.  **Frankie De Jong: 5** - Despite being one of the Dutch future stars, the midfielder is struggling against sides that keep a low block.

    Once again, he has not been able to keep things moving forward as his passes were just fair and square.

    He had very few attempts at penetrating the ball through the opponents set-up and this is becoming a common criticism for the former Ajax star.

8.  **Gini Wijnaldum: 5.5** - The man who plays his club football for PSG did not have one of the best nights in an Oranje jersey.

    He struggled to make things happen in the attacking areas of the Dutch midfield and squandered a few opportunities on goal.

9.  **Noa Long: 7** - Came out all guns blazing in the opening exchanges of the game. He showed a lot of pace, finesse and promise as he helped himself to an assist.

    His levels dropped in the second half, probably got tired as he was substituted, but he can take a lot of pride from his performance.

10. **Steven Berghuis: 6** - He slightly struggled to impress against a weaker opponent. Found it difficult to penetrate or find a really good delivery into the box. Just another off night for the forward.

11. **Memphis Depay: 8.5** - Unlike Berghuis, it was yet another regular day in the office for Memphis Depay as he scored two goals and provided teo assists.


    On the sour note, he missed a penalty, but it was still a really good evening for the Dutch talisman.

    He is edging closer to Robin van Persie's all-time scoring record for Netherlands.

## Substitutes

12. **Arnaut Danjuma: 7.5** - He came on as a substitute and proved a lot of critics wrong if he was supposed to be called up in the squad earlier.


    He has been in good form lately and the Villarreal forward did not waste any time in letting the world know what he has under his locker.

    He scored a fantastic goal and his performance on the field will be one that he will remember.

13. **Wout Weghorst: 6.5** - Got on as a substitute and made an instant impact as he provided an assist.


    He was unfortunate not to score on the night as his headed effort was cleared off the line. He will be pushing for a start against Montenegro or Norway.

14. **Donyell Malen: 8** - Despite coming on the field with just over 10 minutes left on the clock, Malen got himself a goal which will be truly satisfying for him even though he had little time to make an impact in the game.


    He will surely be slightly disappointed as he wasn't used as a starter by Louis Van Gaal in a game in which he could have scored more goals.

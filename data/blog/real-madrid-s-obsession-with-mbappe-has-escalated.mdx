There are just 6 days left for the European transfer market to close as clubs are still on the look-out for additions to their squads ahead of the 2021-22 season.

The Mbappe transfer topic has always been hidden under the rubble as Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United have dominated the transfer market this time around, but Los Blancos have decided to tilt the spot-light towards them. They have done so in tremendous fashion.

On Wednesday night, reports from Spain and France claimed that Real Madrid and Florentino Perez had made their big money move by sending in an official bid for Kylian Mbappe, which is valued at €160 million. The Parisian club have still not accepted the offer from Real Madrid which was presented to them on Sunday.

PSG President - Nasser-Al-Khelaifi, has previously stated on multiple occasions that Mbappe has "no reason" to leave the club.

As PSG kept recruiting world-class players to their squads, the club's president kept delivering the same statement time and time again. It was after the Parisian club signed Messi, that Nasser-Al-Khelaifi spoke in relation to Kylian and said, "He asked for a winning team. We gave him more than that. He has no reason to leave now. "

It seems as though Mbappe has already made his mind up to join Los Blancos. He is eager and passionate about playing and representing himself for one of the greatest clubs in European Football. He was already a World Cup winner at the age of 18 with France, and that speaks volumes about his quality and calibre on the pitch.

But, why doesn't Mbappe want to be a part of a galactic team in Paris???

1.  Real Madrid have lost their reputation recently as Perez stated his desire to form and be a part of the European Super League, which has stalled for now. (Let's not open that can of worms. Shall we?)
2.  There have also been many leaked audios that were leaked by the Spanish newspaper outlet - El Confidencial. Those audios can play the language and words used by Perez against some of the icons of the club, past and present, including the likes of Raul Gonzalez, Iker Casillas, Jose Mourinho, and Cristiano Ronaldo. Well, those audios just dented Real Madrid's image further.
3.  In the same year, at the end of May, Zinedine Zidane announced his departure from the club as head coach as he had publicly stated that he didn't feel that the "club supports and trusts him."

    He further claimed that when results were hard to come by, a lot was said behind the scenes about his form and style of management, in which he stressed the fact that "it seems as though all my achievements in the past few years have been put to bed."

4.  Most importantly, Real Madrid don't have a squad that is as threatening as PSG does. A few notable names in the Los Blancos squad are: Karim Benzema, Eden Hazard, Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, and Thibaut Courtois, who are well into their 30's, except for the Belgian shot-stopper, who is 29. (He'll be in his 30's next season.)

Holy moly buddy! That's a pretty huge dent in Real Madrid's image by now.

But, it still begs the same question. **Why? Why did Mbappe want to leave?**

1.  We have reason to believe that he wants to be at the centre of the project in the club that he plays for. He may feel that he has achieved a lot during his football career and he will look forward to taking added responsibility on his shoulders.

    As Spiderman said, "With great power comes great responsibility." Mbappe certainly has a lot of ammunition and power in his feet, but that has not brought the best out of him for France in the Euros, as they were knocked out of the competition against Switzerland on penalties in which Mbappe was unable to convert his spot-kick.

2.  This might not be spoken about much, but Mbappe probably has a hidden deep desire within him to be the next best behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Those two were players who carried a lot of load on their shoulders on and off the pitch. Carrying the load and expectations of your club, country, fans and expectations is one thing, but delivering results time and time again is a whole different level to the greatness that those two spectacular individuals have mastered upon.

    If Mbappe is looking to take responsibility for bringing out the best version of himself by representing a Real Madrid side that is far from what they used to be, then that's a really good sign of a player that wants to be at the top of his game and be in the spotlight for many years to come.

3.  Speaking of the spotlight, at PSG, a lot of it will be on Messi, Neymar and Sergio Ramos because of the marketing value they bring to the club. Don't get us wrong, Mbappe wouldn't get marketing value for the Parisian club. It's just that we feel that he (Mbappe) doesn't want to be under the shadow of the players around him at PSG. Just like how the rumours were spread about Neymar aiming to get all the spotlight when he left FC Barcelona for PSG.
4.  Another reason why we feel that Mbappe wants to leave is because his childhood idol, Cristiano Ronaldo, represented and played for Real Madrid for 9 years. Mbappe is certainly following in the footsteps of his idol.

There is no doubt regarding the feisty calibre that Mbappe has under his belt. Once unleashed, the French winger could be on a roll for many years to come, bringing in goals, assists and a few choppy tricks along the way for the world to watch.

Florentino Perez is known for finding a way to get Galacticos into his squad, just as he has done with the likes of David Beckham, Kaka, Luis Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo, and many more.

What Real Madrid have done by submitting an official bid on the table?

1.  With the official bid submitted, Real Madrid rang the alarm bell once and signalled to Mbappe that they "ONLY WANT" the French superstar.

    According to various reports, Mbappe has previously denied as many as 6 contract renewals that PSG have offered to the French starlet, which has been rejected by Mbappe himself.

    That is a clear sign that Mbappe is willing to leave PSG either this summer or in the summer of 2022. He has no intention of continuing in Paris as he is willing to seek a new challenge beyond France.

    The ball is definitely in PSG's court. They are in desperate need of a 3-pointer, but the Parisians, along with Nasser-Al-Khelaifi, are currently struggling to get the ball over the hoop on the backboard. (In basketball terms.)

    Here's a reality check on our lives folks- Have you ever been in situations where you keep putting in the effort to get something done, but nobody recognises it? We're certain that you've been there!

    It's the same when it comes to Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid.

2.  Mbappe has constantly expressed his intention in an "indirect way" to leave the club as he is eager to try on a different challenge.

    He has also rejected contract extensions from PSG not just once, or twice, or thrice, but 6 times!

    That's all that Mbappe could do from his side and if Florentino Perez didn't act on the efforts that Mbappe put in, then Real Madrid could be on the verge of:

    - Either losing him on free to another club in the summer of 2022.
    - Or Mbappe could decide to stay and sign a contract extension which would only make it much more difficult and complicated to sign him later on.

Yes, you could say that Real Madrid have gone bonkers to pay €160 million for a player well within his last year of contract, but such is the obsession that Perez has with the French starlet that he is willing to pay to get Mbappe under his wings and add to his legacy as the President of Real Madrid.

On the other hand, PSG have still not made any final call on the bid offered by Real Madrid as they are still keen on tying Mbappe down and keeping him in the club, along with Lionel Messi and Neymar, as a formidable force as the front 3 for PSG. The President, Nasser-Al-Khelaifi, is currently considering the offer on the table.

It is a tough call to make for PSG as they know the quality of the asset they have in Mbappe, and with their ambitions set high to win the Champions League, the need is much greater to try as much as possible to keep Mbappe at the club, which increases their chances of winning their first ever Champions League title in their history.

You could say that Real Madrid's message to PSG is, "Take it or leave it. We're coming for the boy again in a few months!!!"

Time will tell how significant this deal is for Perez as we could see an action packed 5-6 days of the transfer window unfold right in front of us.

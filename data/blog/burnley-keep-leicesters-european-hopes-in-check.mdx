Leicester City may be down in number in terms of the personnel available on display, but they are not short of belief, grit and determination within the squad. A showdown against Burnley at Turf Moor was a fixture that Leicester had to take all 3 points to get their season going again to clinch their top Champions League places for the next season.

Leicester were without six potential first-team players with big hitters in the likes of James Maddison, Harvey Barnes and Jonny Evans all out with Hip, knee and calf injuries respectively. The foxes got off to a poor start with Matej Vydra cashing in by slotting the ball in the top right corner after a sloppy pass from Hamza Choudhary. Leicester pulls back the Burnley onslaught after Kelechi Iheanacho channelled his inner class that any top striker would be proud of. A Flawless finish from Kelechi got Leicester going through their gears after they struggled to contend with Burnley’s high press calling Kasper Schmeichel into action on multiple occasions.

The second half began with Burnley stepping on the gas for most of the second half. Burnley were in full swing at the start of the second half. Chris Wood showed why he is an essential part of that Straight forward 4-4-2 lineup that Sean Dyche offers. Kasper Schmeichel pulled out a flying save from a Chris Wood header to keep Leicester in the game. Ashley Westwood hit the woodwork with a well-timed half volley that caught Schmeichel off-guard as he was well beaten by the shot. Leicester eventually weathered the Burnley storm as they presented decent opportunities to keep Burnley in check. The last ten minutes of the game saw spaces open up for both teams as the Goalkeeper’s had to keep their side in the game.

Youri Tielemans had a deflected shot hit the woodwork as Leicester kept pushing for the winner. Jamie Vardy was relatively quiet on an evening where Burnley were stubborn as ever in defence. There was no shortage of attempts from both sides with 12 and 15 shots for Burnley and Leicester respectively. Out of those, Burnley had 7 on target compared to Leicester’s 4.

Burnley were close, but not close enough to get all 3 points as Schmeichel keeps Burnley at bay as the points were shared on Turf Moor. Leicester are on 3rd in the Premier League table with Burney 6 points clear of the drop-zone at 29 points. Both these reputed managers will be pretty satisfied with the result with Brendan Rodgers the happier among the two. Leicester travels to Brighton at the weekend while Burnley welcome Arsenal at Turf Moor.

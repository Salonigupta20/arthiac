Next up, we take you to Birmingham, where Aston Villa will be our primary focus for today. With 20 days to go until the start of the 2021-22 Premier League season, we take a slightly deeper dive into the alphabet "A."

We look into every department that the Villans have to offer for FPL managers around the world that would want to consider a potential opening for Villa asset(s) to enter their teams.

As FPL managers, we always aim to get players that have potential, as those Aston Villa boys are not short of potential. Just over a month ago, Dean Smith stated that the Villa owners were determined to turn the club into an "elite" among the others as European football looks well within touching distance.

Dean Smith has a formidable pair of assistants around him as they seem to have gelled together as a coaching unit. John Terry has been remarkable behind the scenes as they tightened up their defensive line that helped them to have a brilliant Premier League campaign.

According to the latest reports, John Terry is not in pole position to succeed Steve Cooper as Swansea City manager, who had left his post by mutual consent. It has emerged that John Eustace remains as the primary frontrunner for the job.

Despite the bags of experience that John Terry has had on the pitch and as an assistant to Dean Smith, the former Chelsea centre-back has not yet taken up a managerial role. For a short while, he was tipped to take the hot seat in South Wales for the very first time. Only time will tell where John Terry ends up this season. Our assumption is that he will remain as Dean Smith’s assistant for the 2021-22 season and then push forward for a managerial role in the near future.

As far as we can tell, as long as John Terry remains with the Villans, you can once again expect really good potential defensive options to consider in the Villa backline that will also assist the Villa boys upfront to flourish. In this article, we will take a look at Aston Villa’s guaranteed/potential key players, starters and player potential.

## Aston Villa in 2020-21

---

Dean Smith and his men were impressive last time out as they ended their campaign in the bottom-half of the Premier League table where they ended up finishing 11th in the 2020-21 season. Despite their final league position, all is not doom and gloom for the Villans as they got off to a flying start to the campaign where they even claimed top spot for a short while.

Stunning results such as the 7-2 win over Liverpool at Villa Park have set the benchmark for this Aston Villa side that has continued to provide their fans and FPL managers with delight. Dean Smith, along with his notable assistants, John Terry and Craig Shakespeare, has taken Aston Villa to greater heights and much more will be expected from them by their fans as the future looks bright.

## What to Expect from Aston Villa in the FPL?

---

Aston Villa are surely aiming for any form of European football next season. An impressive campaign once again may just put Aston Villa in a European Competition. As FPL managers, we need players to play for teams that have high ambitions. Adding to that, FPL managers hunt for players that are highly determined to have an impressive campaign.

Aston Villa are nothing short of "Determined". With fans returning, Aston Villa are set to put on performances that will hit the roof at Villa Park. They were courageous last season, when they performed way above expectations, and their fans will be eager to watch their boys play.

## Players as Potential "Regular" Starters

---

### Goalkeeper

1. **Emiliano Martinez** – **£5.5m** – Martinez had got his stint to be Arsenal’s number 1 in goal as Leno had suffered due to injury. After an impressive end to the 2019-20 campaign, Arsenal were not really satisfied with the Argentinian and were set to keep him as back up to Bernd Leno.

   But, a highly ambitious Martinez was determined to be the first choice goalkeeper. He signed for Aston Villa the same year and played throughout the entire 2020-21 campaign. He is a highly rated shot-stopper as he has been very commanding in goal marshalling his back-line. Talk about 143 saves! If you were a Martinez owner last season, he was all about save after save after save!!!

   He is set to maintain his high standards this season, especially after his impressive Copa America campaign in which he helped Argentina lift their first ever international trophy after 28 long years. His "regularity" in making saves has allowed him to keep clean sheets as well as assist his defenders to get a higher FPL point score if they have scored or assisted. To sum up,

   Emiliano Martinez – A Point Banker.

### Defenders

1. **Targett** – **Left-back** – **£5.0m** – Matt Targett got off to a positive start in the beginning of the 2020-21 campaign where he recorded 2 general assists plus the additional fantasy assists to his name. He was among the highly owned defenders in the FPL game and showed really good prospects while going up front in attack.

   He is also good at set-pieces and delivers a really good ball from time to time, with the odd "lack-in-quality" in his deliveries. Altogether, he is a really good pick if you are looking for a defender with good/decent attacking potential.

2. **Mings** – **Centre-back** – **£5.0m** – Tyrone Mings has been a giant and physical personnel in the Villa back-line. He is a regular starter for the Villans and he also provides a good attacking threat on set-pieces.

   His stats record in the 2020-21 Premier League follows with 2 goals and 2 assists. He also carries a yellow card with him occasionally. But, that shouldn’t put you off. Clean sheets and a few goals are sure to come their way, along with bonus points. Get the big man in!

3. **Konsa** – **Centre-back** – **£5.0m** – Ezri Konsa has been another regular phenomenal figure in the Aston Villa back-line. He was a part of Aston Villa’s success last season. He’s recorded 2 goals to his name and stood up when the others failed.

   If you need a differential pick from the Villa back-line, Ezri Konsa is your man without a doubt. He is set to pick up bonuses and the odd goal/assist as well.

4. **Cash** – **Right-back** – **£5.0m** – Matty Cash has made 28 Premier League appearances in the 2020-21 campaign. He recorded 2 assists last season as well as a total of 7 yellow cards. As for us, he is one to avoid.

### Midfielders

1. **Traore** – **£6.0m** – Bertrand Traore is a decisive left-footer who takes on defenders for fun, which makes him a really good fantasy asset for FPL managers to consider. He is a regular starter provided that he remains fit and injury free.

   He drives and eases through the heart of the opposition defence and creates multiple goal-scoring opportunities. He is also among the potential set-piece takers at Aston Villa.

2. **Buendia** – **£6.5m** – Emiliano Buendia has secured a transfer to Aston Villa for a club record fee of 35m pounds on a 5-year deal. He is set to have a free role at Aston Villa, who have been highly impressive during his time at Norwich in the Championship. He’s had a Premier League stint in the 2019-20 campaign with Norwich, where they were relegated.

   Numbers while at Norwich City:

   | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | Premier League <br /> 2019-20 | 36      | 1     | 7       |
   | Championship <br /> 2020-21   | 39      | 15    | 16      |

   Those numbers speak for themselves. He is a highly creative player who has the high potential to get you loads of Fantasy Points for your FPL team.

3. **El Ghazi** – **£6.0m** – The Dutch footballer has got some serious pace and prowess in him. He is on penalties and free kicks when he is on the pitch. He is also a selfish player because he has the goal in his sights. This is also a good factor to consider, as selfish players are bound to provide more FPL points. But, again, this can be debatable.

   His stats have shown that he is a player who is set to get better this season with numbers that prove his worth. In the 2020-21 campaign, he has made 28 appearances in the Premier League, largely due to the shin injury to Jack Grealish.

   In those 28 appearances, El Ghazi has scored 10 goals. His Premier League appearances are a combination of starting and substitute appearances.

   If Jack Grealish decides to make a move away from Villa Park this season, El Ghazi is set to fill his boots and he has the potential to rock and roll!

4. **McGinn** – **£6.0m** – The Scottish international has been "the tank" in the heart of Aston Villa’s midfield. He’s got enormous drive and energy to push the team forward along with him. He is a regular starter and he usually plays as a Central Defensive Midfielder.

   He has a very good physical presence and plays a vital role in assisting Villa’s back four in defending. He also has the calibre to roll a ball through the opposition defence and create a good goal-scoring opportunity.

   What Is Our Opinion? Avoid unless he hits a scoring/assist streak.

5. **Grealish** – **£8.0m** – He is surely one to consider if he stays at Villa Park this season. He is undeniably Aston Villa’s talisman in front of goal. He has an amazing repertoire that draws defenders to him and creates space for others to flourish.

   With the arrival of Buendia and defensive additions in midfield (Sanson), Jack Grealish may prove his worth again this season, as he has been a stellar performer for the Villans over the years.

   His numbers when he is on the ball are sensational. While at the Euros, he played his part for England largely as a substitute. But, he still managed to provide 2 assists for his countrymen.

   As far as the Premier League numbers are concerned, Jack Grealish’s figures are adored.

   | Campaign - Premier League | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2019-20                   | 36      | 8     | 6       |
   | 2020-21                   | 26      | 6     | 10      |

   With the likes of McGinn, Sanson, Traore, El Ghazi, and Buendia, Jack Grealish is tipped to be an instrumental figure in carrying this Aston Villa side to European football provided that he stays fit and injury-free.

   What Is Our Opinion? His demand and "Value for worth" in FPL may vary if he decides to move away from Birmingham.

### Forward

1. **Watkins** – **£7.5m** – Ollie Watkins has been one of the surprise packages of this Aston Villa squad. He has been criticised and doubted on multiple occasions in the 2020-21 campaign, but he has gone on to prove that he deserves to be at the club.

   In his impressive campaign, he has gone on to score a total of 168 FPL points, which is truly remarkable considering that he came in last season at a really attractive price of 6.0m.

   His stats in his 1st season at Villa Park have been really good. He has started every game for the Villans except for the one where he was sent off after receiving consecutive yellow cards. His discipline on the field is not an issue.

   His numbers on the pitch matter to him. He is a determined player and runs at full throttle throughout the 90 minutes of the game. In the 2020-21 campaign, he recorded 14 goals and 5 assists along with fantasy assists.

   Our thoughts? – If he gets going on a scoring streak, catch the train. He may also potentially be a player that FPL managers have to swap in and out of their sides depending on his performance and potential for FPL points.

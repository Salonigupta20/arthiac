### 1. Illan Meslier: 7

The young French goalkeeper distributed the ball really well with his boys in front of him.

He brought out his biggest save when Cooper gave the ball away to Tielemans as he reacted quickly to come out and clear the ball.

He couldn't do much with the goal conceded.

### 2. Liam Cooper: 6

He was pretty good on the day. He was defensively solid and did well overall, although he had a few "if-fy" moments in the game.

### 3. Diego Llorente: 6.5

He too had a pretty good game in defence along with his captain Cooper. He kept Leicester at bay for most parts of the game, although he could've done better for the goal conceded.

### 4. Pascal Struijk: 7

He did extremely well by filling in at the back in a back 3 for Bielsa. He was crucial to cover up and contain the Leicester City attack. He was really good in his positioning in the game and kept himself disciplined.

### 5. Stuart Dallas: 7

The right wing back was exceptional once again at Elland Road as his energy and drive made a good match with Raphinha as they both linked up really well to push forward and cause some real chaos down the left hand side of the Foxes' defence.

### 6. Kalvin Phillips: 6

The defensive midfielder had a decent game at Elland Road and he was unfortunate not to get an assist to his name. Played much more upfront with Forshaw sitting back.

### 7. Adam Forshaw: 8

He was really good on the ball and kept it moving forward with intent. He worked really hard on and off the ball. He will be a key part in Bielsa's plans for the remainder of the season.

### 8. Harrison: 7

The ex-Man City midfielder once again put in the hard yards in the game. He moved the ball really quick up front and linked up play well with his teammates.

He constantly looked to get his head up and deliver the cross into the box continuously. An energetic performance from the winger.

He will be disappointed as he couldn't adjust himself right in front of goal as the ball arrived at him quickly from a clipped header from Kalvin Phillips.

### 9. Dan James: 5.5

The attacking midfielder who came in from Manchester to Yorkshire is still struggling to find his feet in this Leeds team. He's been relatively quiet so far this season.

He was good on the ball, but he needs to improve himself in terms of the end product he delivers.

### 10. Raphinha: 8

The Brazilian winger was sensational in the first half as his wicked delivery into the box was left alone by the onrushing Leeds attackers which slid through Kasper Schmeichel.

He was booked for his celebration as he took off his shirt.

He was electric and lively especially when he had the ball on his feet.

### 11. Rodrigo: 6.5

The Spanish striker is much more different than Bamford, but he is settling really well into this new role that he has taken since the injury to Bamford.

He is a player that moves the ball in quickly and gets things going in the final third for the Yorkshire club.

## Substitutes

### 12. Tyler Roberts: 4

Came on and did well to a certain extent as his workload was cut down much more defensively.

### 13. Charlie Cresswell: N/A

---

## Leicester City

### 1. Kasper Schmeichel: 6

He couldn't really distribute the ball well across to his players. His opposition keeper, Meslier won by a mile when it comes to ball distribution.

He was well beaten by Raphinha's free kick, but he did make a few good saves in the game.

### 2. Ricardo Pereira: 5

He was not at his best today with Jack Harrison bursting down his side. He made 6 tackles in the game, but he was way off his best when it came to going forward.

### 3. Jonny Evans: 7.5

The veteran defender was much more calm and composed in defence as he read the situation really well and kept things at relative ease for large portions of the game while Leeds were on the attack.

### 4. Caglar Soyuncu: 5.5

The Turkish centre back has not been able to make an impact so far since the season began.

He was also restless while Leeds came down attacking at his end. He had a chance to get a goal during the final few minutes of the game, but his effort on target was cut out by an onrushing Leeds defender who came in sliding.

### 5. Timothy Castagne: 6

The Belgian versatile left back did pretty well in defense. However, he was not put to the test by James, although Raphinha caused a few problems.

He couldn't make an attacking contribution in the game just as Ricardo Pereira.

### 6. Wilfred Ndidi: 7

Given his role in this Leicester side, he did really well to keep Leicester in the game. Did a lot of defensive work and looked to keep his side on the front foot.

### 7. Youri Tielemans: 7.5

The Belgian was constantly looking forward to make an impact in the game.

He did keep Meslier on his heels at times and was a constant menace with his runs and deliveries up front. Subbed off later on in the game with an injury.

### 8. Boubakary Soumare: 7

The new signing made an instant impact in this team. He supplied the assist to Barnes' goal and did well defensively as well. There is more to him which we should see after the international break.

### 9. Ademola Lookman: 5

He had his own share of chances to make a much bigger impact in the game in favour of Leicester, but he is probably lacking sharpness in the final third as he has not been playing regularly.

His only downfall is his decision making as he was too late to spot the overall situation of the game.

He scored a goal, but his foot was slightly caught offside.

### 10. Jamie Vardy: 6.5

The veteran striker always kept making some good forward runs, but his teammates couldn't spot him. He found it difficult to link up with Lookman.

### 11. Harvey Barnes: 7.5

He found his way back into the starting XI and he was looking to create a spark for his side and he scored a worldie which brought a huge grin on his face.

It was a much needed goal for his confidence and the Leicester fans will be hoping that he continues to deliver for their side.

## Substitutes

### 12. Daniel Amartey: 5

He came in to help out Leicester's defense and did relatively well.

### 13. Dewsbury-Hall: 5

He did quite well as he kept possession of the ball and kept passing it forward.

### 14. James Maddison: 6

Came on as a sub and looked to create a few chances, but lacked the cutting edge.

Are the smiles back for the Old Lady from Turin?

Can Bianconeri fans expect their team to reign supreme once more?

Ummâ€¦.Nahh, we don't think so!

Juventus finally claimed their first win of the season after 4 match-weeks this season. The Old Lady finally made hay and cut loose at the Alberto Picco stadium in La Spezia as a De Ligt right-footed strike from a corner sealed all 3 points for the Old Lady of Turin.

Allegri was seen grinning at his players and staff at the 6th minute mark of stoppage time.

But, can he afford that smile?

So far, the Old Lady does not appear to have been convincing in any of their five Serie A games.They've always been under pressure and they feel the heat when the opposition comes knocking at their door.

It is safe to say that Allegri and the Bianconeri fans no longer have to stare at a big fat zero when they look at the points table in the "Wins" column.

Honestly, it's been a ride for Juventus and their fans as they required a lot of resilience and patience to win their first game in Serie A.

It took time, but it was partially worth the wait! However, the big boys in the league won't sit around like a pack of camels in the desert as they are up for the sprint to win Serie A this season while Juve are still down the pecking order to be favourites to win the league from the position that they find themselves in. (We'll come back to that later.)

The least Juventus could do last night was to show that they are still within contention to challenge for the title. At the end of the day, you can't be in a position where you lose the league in September itself. Can you?

Taking the stats from last season, Juventus have gone 19 games in a row in Serie A without registering a clean sheet. Now, that is a very long time considering that Italian sides bank and take great pride in their defense.Over the years, Italian football has been based on their defence with their own little Italian finesse of attack.

Italy currently has the calibre and quality of players that have given their brand of football a much more attacking flavour in recent years.

However, with the calibre of players that Juve have in their armoury at the back with the likes of De Ligt, Bonucci and Chiellini, you wouldn't expect a stat like that to appear on your timeline. Would you?

Yeah, you could say that Bonucci and Chiellini are beyond their prime years, but after Chiellini's outstanding performances at the Euro's, you still feel that the veteran has a lot in his legs to give the Old Lady.

## Do teams fear Juventus?

Over the years, when Juve were at their prime, you could say "Yes", but after their performances last season, you could see that the empire they built started crumbling and boy, how it came crashing down when Juve were in the relegation zone without a win. That news is block-buster stuff if you're a Milan fan on either side of the city, more so if you are a fan of Torino.

A potential relegation side in Spezia took the game to Juve and a stunning save from Wojciech Szczesny in the dying minutes of the game kept Juve's lead intact.

According to the stats last night against Spezia, Juve had 61% of ball possession with them and nearly thrice the number of shots on goal, but their defending has been so bad, they've just been lucky to concede twice against the minnows.

If you're a Juve fan, you must have breathed a sigh of relief when Federico Chiesa levelled the scoreline and you probably roared like a maturing lion when De Ligt fired the ball into the net, but Juventus eased their foot off the gas and they invited pressure from the hosts.

You must've been sitting there holding on to your coffee pretty tight or you must have bit your nails fine, because you knew that your side were just not pulling the strings in midfield or in defence to bail Juve out as they usually do. That's just how things are right now with the Bianconeri side and that has to be accepted when you see your side going through a tricky phase in their illustrious club career.

## Where does Juve stand right now in the Title race?

Well, as promised earlier, we're back at the title race.

Juventus currently sit in 13th place in the Serie A table as they took a significant jump out of the relegation zone with their first win away from home at La Spezia.

However, whenever you and I hear about Juventus, your mind just tells you, "Title winners." That's just an indicator of the levels that Juventus have risen over the years in which they have built a strong image for themselves in the minds of football lovers all over the world. That is an achievement on it's own and if you're a fan of the black and white of Turin, you must be proud.

Well, if you're a neutral, your views might just change about Juventus now. They are a side who are just losing ground on their dominance in Italian football over the last two years.

At this point in time, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Napoli, Atalanta, Roma, Fiorentina and Lazio have all got a better head start in Serie A so far this season. Even Sassuolo have been a better side than Juve.

Right now, we see five sides challenging for the title, and as sad as it may sound, Juve are not in those 5.

If you take a look at the smaller sides they have faced this season, they played against Udinese who troubled the Old Lady at the penultimate stages of the previous season and that was when the Portuguese superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo headed in a winner from a very narrow angle which potential saved Andrea Pirlo's job for the time being.

Juve don't look solid and strong as a side that would brush away their opponents as they used to in the past. They look fragile and delicate in midfield and in defence. Opponents can break through Allegri's defence and score a goal or two.

The only positive for Juventus right now is that they have played two games out of five in Serie A against the title challenging sides in Napoli and AC Milan. That is probably the silver lining for Allegri and his support staff.

However, you cannot afford to "blow a lead" just as they did against Udinese, Napoli and AC Milan a few weeks ago.

Either Allegri is getting it wrong midway through the game or their opponents are just more hungry and determined than the Old Lady.

As far as we know, the Old Lady is always determined! It's about time they build their biceps to take the hits and build from it. Right now, Juve are clearly dependent on their strike force from the likes of Paulo Dybala, Alvaro Morata, Federico Chiesa and Moise Kean to get them over the line. Yes, you need goals to secure all 3 points and climb up the table, but you need to keep the balance as your midfielders and defenders need to come into the fold. De Ligt could be satisfied if he gives us a read. LOL. Haha.

At the end of the day, it's just about "Resilience." This squad definitely needs added quality in their squad, but it's about effort and resilience that will get this Juve side challenging to be amongst the others for the title anytime soon for now.

It's too early to make a call, but in time, we will clearly see where Juve are headed.

For now, Allegri and Juve can breathe quite easily, but they need to be aware that they cannot afford to rest so soon and the hard yards begin now!

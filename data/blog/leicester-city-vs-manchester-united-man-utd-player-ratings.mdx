**The pressure piles on to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as his side have been poor on a day they had to win to build up their confidence ahead of a hectic and tough fixture schedule in front of them.**

**Tielemans, Soyuncu, Jamie Vardy and Patson Daka ended Man Utd's 29 game unbeaten streak away from home as Leicester piled onto Manchester United's misery.**

**Here are the player ratings of Manchester United:**

### 1. David De Gea: 8

Given how well Leicester were in the game, he was still able to pull out multiple saves to deny the Foxes and keep Man Utd in the game.

### 2. Aaron Wan-Bissaka: 5.5

It was yet another game where the right back made an impact in the game in the defensive half for Man Utd.

His defensive efforts tailed off late on in the game as the Leicester players had the better of him physically.

He even received a yellow card in the build up to the third goal for the hosts.

### 3. Victor Lindelof: 6

He received a yellow card for a rash challenge on Jamie Vardy.

He looked steady at the back for Man Utd unlike his partner, Maguire.

Grabbed a fine assist in the game with a really good diagonal ball for the onrushing Marcus Rashford.

### 4. Harry Maguire: 2

Started the game off on the wrong note.

He gave Leicester the equaliser as Leicester broke through from Iheanacho who supplied the assist to Tielemans.

He was extremely poor at the back. Many misplaced passes and lost Daka for Leicester's fourth goal of the afternoon.

### 5. Luke Shaw: 5.5

He looked to provide some attacking potential from the left hand side for Man Utd, but his deliveries were far from good.

He nearly got one to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese could not capitalise on it.

### 6. Matic: 6

He was actually calm and collective in front of Man Utd's back four.

Collected the ball well and pushed forward with it on multiple occasions. Looked to drive Man Utd out from the back on a few occasions.

Had one effort on goal from distance which kept Schmeichel on his toes. His performance tailed off at the back end of the game.

This performance will surely give Ole something to think about when it comes to the personnel he has to use in that defensive midfield position.

### 7. Pogba: 5

The recently crowned Nations League winner was poor on the day as he had the ball stolen off him many times in the game.

He looked lost in the game and was far from his best. It was certainly not a performance that Pogba had displayed a few nights ago in the Nations League final.

Got booked in the later stages of the second half.

### 8. Mason Greenwood: 7

The Man Utd wonderkid came up with a stunning strike in the first half of the game to give the Red Devils the lead.

However, he could not build on from that goal as he couldn't get his left foot to produce a goal even when he was found by Ronaldo and co. in really good open spaces.

### 9. Bruno Fernandes: 5.5

It was yet another disappointing night for the Portuguese midfielder as he was way off his best.

He was once again unable to deliver and was grumpy more often than not.

Found a fine pass to Rashford at the far corner and one cross into the box for Ronaldo, but he just couldn't make a significant difference in the game.

### 10. Jadon Sancho: 5

He started the game well this time around as he grew in confidence as the game progressed.

After Leicester scored the equaliser, he couldn't be seen much with the ball at his feet and he had a quiet second half.

He was taken off first in the game for Man Utd.

### 11. Cristiano Ronaldo: 5.5

The Portuguese icon couldn't capitalise on a good goal scoring opportunity in the first half.

Although, he tried to help out his teammates in the middle of the park to keep the ball rolling forward.

Tried hard to get on the end of a looping ball, but his outstretched legs couldn't make enough contact.

He had a quiet day, but he'll be back stronger.

## Substitutes

### 12. Rashford: 7

Came on and looked to inject some serious pace to trouble the Leicester defence.

Came up with a really good goal as he was clinical after making a really good run in behind the Foxes defence.

### 13. Scott McTominay: 3

Came on late in the game and lost the ball a few times. Couldn't make an impact.

### 14. Jesse Lingard: 4

Couldn't do much in the game, but had a shot on goal and that was yet another quiet appearance for Lingard as a substitute.

# Spain

### Unai Simon: 6.5

He had a quiet first half, although he was feeling the heat of the game as his handling of the ball was questioned.

He was beaten twice by a wonder goal from Benzema and a fine finish from Mbappe.

### Marcos Alonso: 6

Went forward with real menace at times and he was up to the paces with Mbappe.

### Laporte: 6.5

He was rock solid at the back as he put up an aerial fight against the French.

Got booked in the game which lowered his overall rating.

### Eric Garcia: 5.5

He has always looked like the opponents could breach past him as he struggled to keep up to the paces in the game.

Although, he did clean up a few attacks from the French.

### Cesar Azpilicueta: 6.5

The Chelsea man was influential in the game in a defensive role, but he was unable to cause any real threat and menace up front for Spain.

### Rodri: 5.5

The Man City midfielder did not have any significant impact in the game.

He made a few rough challenges as he escaped from a yellow card. Did a lot of sweeping for the Spaniard's.

### Busquets: 7

The Barca defensive midfielder rolled back the years and performed really well in the heart of Spain's defence.

He also had a few cheeky moves in the locker in this fixture.

### Gavi: 6

The youngster came in hard on Pogba within the opening exchanges of the game and was lucky not to get booked.

Seemed like he was in the leniency books of the referee. Put in an industrial performance in midfield.

### Pablo Sarabia: 5.5

The hardworking lad in the Spanish side (as mentioned by Enrique) could not make a difference in the game. Struggled and subbed off.

### Oyarzabal: 7

Had a quiet day at the office in attack, but bounced off Upamecano to give Spain the lead. Was much more quiet in the second half.

### Ferran Torres: 5.5

The Man City forward could not live up to expectations and he was unable to set his mark in the game.

## Substitutes

### Yeremi Pino: 6

Came on and looked more threatening with his pace and amateur dancing feet.

### Koke: 5

He came on and did most of his work defensively.

### Merino: 3

Nothing much from the midfielder.

### Pablo Fornals: 4

The West Ham forward had a really good opportunity to go for goal himself, instead, he passed and the French got back in time to close down the gap.

### Lloris: 7.5

He was relatively quiet in the first half. Couldn't do much with Spain's goal, but he came up with two fantastic saves at the end of the second half. Led like a captain!

### Kimpembe: 7.5

He was the only bright spark for France in defence while the rest were struggling to keep up to pace with the Spaniards.

Read the game well and came up with some really good tackles.

### Varane: 5.5

The Man Utd defender did well to keep things tight and compact at the back. Sadly, he was subbed off just before half-time as it looks like he's got a really bad injury.

### Kounde: 6

The Centre-back found himself in good attacking areas in the game.

However, he got lucky as VAR had decided not to give in a penalty as a cross hit his trailing arm as he attempted to block the path of Oyarzabal. He even got booked.

### Theo Hernandez: 7.5

He had immense drive in him sprinting up and down the field with the ball at his feet.

Came into really good attacking positions as he could've scored in the second half. Ultimately, he got an assist.

### Paul Pogba: 8

He had one of the games of his career. He was being brought down multiple times in the game by the Spanish players, but he always looked for solutions and found a way out of the Spanish press with some mesmerising footwork.

He also got booked in the first half. Played with emotion and heart which brought the best out of Paul Pogba.

### Tchouameni: 6

One of the highlights of his day out was when he came in with a really good challenge on Gavi in the penalty box.

He also made a few forward runs, stretching out the Spanish defence, but most of his work was cut out to do the dirty side of the game by sweeping and breaking up play.

### Pavard: 6.5

He has to be given the credit for trying. He's not a wing-back in nature, but marauded forward with real intent.

Kept his team first before himself and put in the hard yards on the field. Subbed off and looked annoyed.

### Griezmann: 6

He made a century of appearances in French colours. He had a pretty good first half, but soon things died and got quiet with the Atletico Madrid striker in the second half.

He looked to link up well with his team mates, but couldn't really make a big difference in the game.

### Mbappe: 7.5

It just wasn't his night at the San Siro. Gave away possession many times in the game.

He also had a few attempts on goal, but he couldn't make good contact as he barely troubled Simon in the Spanish goal.

However, football is about moments and Mbappe saw the moment to score and he grabbed his opportunity with both hands (with controversy surrounding that goal)

### Benzema: 8.5

He left off just as he did in the game against Belgium. Read the game well, dropped deep, kept the ball moving, kept France on the front foot, found open spaces and found his teammates with ease.

It was a joy to watch"Karim the Dream" play.

Took his goal really well. Breath-taking goal. Closed down on the Spanish defenders really well too.

He was a key part to the puzzle that brought France back into the game.

## Substitutes

### Upamecano: 5.5

Came on for Varane. Looked like he was feeling the heat of the game and the occasion.

Gave away the first goal as he was easily brushed off by Oyarzabal.

He also had many misplaced pases and will have to thank Lloris for not punishing him.

### Dubois: 6

Came on for Pavard. Good levels of energy with one really dazzling run just outside the penalty box. Contributed well defensively as well.

### Veretout

Came on at the final four minutes of the game. Can't rate him.

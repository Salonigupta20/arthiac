### PSG edge out all 3 points as Kylian Mbappe seals the deal at the Parc des Princes

Paris Saint-Germain took on Angers without the likes of their South American contingent of players in Lionel Messi, Neymar, Angel Di Maria and Keylor Navas.

PSG had to chase for the majority of the game after Angelo Fulgini gave the visitors a shock lead in the first half.

Angers were pushing forward well as they were quick on the counter and after several attempts, they were able to breach Gianluigi Donnarumma in goal.

That goal raised the tension in the atmosphere as Mauricio Pochettino and his star-studded boys were unable to dominate the game against a much weaker opponent.

The game went on and PSG were looking for an equaliser and the Portuguese defensive midfielder, Danilo came up with the breakthrough as his header levelled the score line as Mbappe came up with the assist with just over 20 minutes left on the clock.

PSG were going for the win at full throttle where they were able to muster a penalty after Icardi's header was off target, but with the ball brushing off the arm of Angers' Pierrick Capelle, PSG were given a lifeline.

Kylian Mbappe stood up and converted the spot kick to give the Parisians the lead as PSG narrowly escaped from a slip up in Ligue 1.

Angers were undone by a controversial penalty call as Mauricio Pochettino will be concerned that his side have not been convincing enough so far this season.

Here are the player ratings for PSG:

### 1. Gianluigi Donnarumma: 6.5

The Italian goalkeeper was put to the test in the first half as he was beaten by Angelo Fulgini's goal.

However, he had a relatively quiet second half.

### 2. Abdou Diallo: 6

The left-back was constantly looking to make an impact in the attacking third of the game for PSG, but Angers were able to restrict him time and time again.

Whenever he got through on the left hand side, his crosses were way beyond target.

### 3. Kimpembe: 7.5

The French defender was given the armband. Despite the fact that PSG conceded a goal, the French defender was still one of the most sublime player's on the field for PSG as he came in with well-timed challenges and key interceptions.

### 4. Thilo Kehrer: 6.5

He was good moving forward as he registered a 97% pass completion rate.

Angers caught him out on the break and looked to exploit his territory. He will improve with time.

### 5. Colin Dagba: 6

The right back was exploited when Angers took the lead.

Since then, he was unable to offer anything more in the attacking third for PSG.

### 6. Ander Herrera: 7

The midfielder was one of the creative sparks for PSG against a low block Angers side.

He found a good pass to Mbappe earlier in the first half. Herrera found the back of the net from his headed effort, but his goal was ruled out for offside.

He nearly gave PSG the lead as he latched onto one just wide of the post.

### 7. Danilo Pereira: 7.5

The Portuguese midfielder was good in possession and kept his team rolling forward by finding his teammates in attacking positions.

He gave PSG the equaliser as he headed in Mbappe's left-footed cross.

### 8. Marco Verratti: 7.5

The Italian midfielder who got the love and affection from Pep Guardiola two weeks ago was at it again in the heart of PSG's midfield as he created a few good chances in the game with his passing and movement.

### 9. Rafinha: 6

He had gone for goal from a set piece which was from a narrow angle.

He had two chances to score, but his efforts were wide. He did not return out on the field in the second half.

### 10. Icardi: 6

Ever since he made his move to Paris permanently, he has not been able to convince the supporters with his goal-scoring ability.

Once again, he had the opportunity to impress Pochettino, but the Argentine striker had struggled to make an impact even though he won his side a controversial penalty.

### 11. Mbappe: 8.5

The French forward took all the responsibility on his shoulders as he provided an assist and scored a penalty goal to give PSG all 3 valuable points as they continue their quest to win the domestic league.

As ever, Mbappe was the key to PSG's comeback in the game and he was their main route to score goals.

He was able to link up well with his teammates and he had a few adventurous attempts at goal.

Overall, he had a good night out.

## Substitutes

### 12. Juan Bernat: 5

The midfielder made his return from an ankle injury that kept him away for a long while.

His arrival on the field was greeted by a loud reception from the home fans, but he couldn't make a significant impact in the game.

### 13. Wijnaldum: 5.5

The Dutch midfielder's work was mostly on the defensive side of things as he too couldn't do much with the ball from an attacking point of view.

### 14. Achraf Hakimi: 7.5

PSG's expensive signing this summer was a constant threat on the right flank for PSG as he gave the Angers defenders a good run for their money.

### 15. Julian Draxler: 5

The German kept the ball moving from time to time, but he couldn't find a creative pass to break down the low Angers block in defence.

### 16. Eric Ebimbe: N/A

Came on with a few minutes left on the clock. He didn't have the time to make an impact.

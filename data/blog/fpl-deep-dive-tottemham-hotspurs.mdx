Next up, we travel about 160 odd miles from Manchester to London. Precisely, we look at North London where we analyse Spurs from an FPL perspective. In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Tottenham did not get off to a good start. They lost their first home game 1-0 under the former manager, Jose Mourinho, against Everton.

However, things changed as the weeks went by. A few months down the line, until December, Tottenham were table toppers for about 4 weeks.

There was a lot of hope that Jose Mourinho could lead this Spurs side to Premier League title glory, but they were still a long way off from that coming into reality.

Spurs’ biggest test came against Liverpool on the 16th of December, 2020, as that was a game that would decide who was going to be table toppers by the time Christmas and New Year came along.

Tottenham travelled to Anfield where they lost 2-1. Since then, things have changed. Tottenham’s form dropped and their league position kept dropping as weeks went by. Their drop in form was an epic example of their fall from grace.

Although Mourinho was pulling out results, it wasn’t enough for Spurs to keep pace with the others at the top end of the Premier League table.

A few days later, Spurs lost at home to high-flying Leicester City 2-0. This was another result that dented the overall progress of Tottenham Hotspur. It was also a sign to all those connected to Spurs that the Premier League title wasn’t going to come too easily for them.

A week later, on Boxing Day weekend, Spurs drew 1-1 away at Molineux Stadium against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Those alarm bells rang louder that this wasn’t going to be a Premier League winning season.

As months went by, Mourinho couldn’t bring out winning results from this Spurs side. However, he still took them to the Carabao Cup Final vs Manchester City.

On the 19th of April, 2021, Jose Mourinho was sacked by Daniel Levy along with his coaching staff following a string of unsuccessful results and league position.

A week before the Carabao Cup final, Ryan Mason, a former Spurs player, was appointed as interim head coach of the Lilywhites until the season was over. He was left with a huge task to try and get Tottenham into the Champions League spots.

Ryan Mason's debut game in charge was against Southampton. He won his first game as a Tottenham manager. His next game was against Manchester City in the League Cup final, where his side suffered a 1-0 defeat.

Spurs ended their Premier League campaign by winning 4-2 away from home against Leicester City. It was an entertaining encounter where Gareth Bale came off the bench to score twice. That sealed all 3 points for Spurs.

Ryan Mason was able to guide Spurs to a 7th place finish in the league table in which Spurs will play in an all-new European competition known as the "UEFA Europa Conference League."

## What to Expect from Spurs in FPL?

---

Chairman Daniel Levy said he was "acutely aware" of the need for a change in approach, a return to the club's values, about halfway through the lengthy search for a new head coach. He described the approach and club values as "free-flowing, attacking, and entertaining."

Daniel Levy appointed Nuno Espirito Santo (NES) as the head coach of Tottenham Hotspur for the 2020-21 Premier League season.

But, does he fit the approach and values that Daniel Levy envisioned?

We don’t think so!

As far as we have seen Nuno in the Premier League with Wolves, he has been a "reactive manager" for large portions of his time at Molineux.

In recent years, the Portuguese could hardly claim to have created a significant number of performances that satisfy the criteria that Levy looks for. At Wolves, Nuno took a defensive approach by defending deep.

But, he has promised that we (him + his staff + his players) will make those connected to Spurs proud. We will have to wait and see.

On the other hand, we also feel that Nuno took a defensive approach at Wolves because he didn’t have the luxury of high-quality players as he does right now at Spurs.

We could debate that, but let’s just keep that for another day. Should we?

With Nuno Espirito Santo's arrival, we can expect the Spurs to be much more dynamic in the way they attack. It is not yet clear about the formation they will use, but we can expect a lot of FPL points from players who play on the wings for Spurs. At the same time, Nuno is known for his defensive stats. A lot will unfold as the season kicks on.

## Players as Potential “Regular” Starters

---

### Goalkeepers

1.  **Lloris** - **£5.5m** - Currently, Hugo Lloris is owned by 4.3 % of FPL managers worldwide. He is also their Captain. He is a definite regular starter for the Lilywhites.

Even though Tottenham have signed Pierluigi Gollini on loan from Atalanta, the minutes of Hugo Lloris in the Premier League are not going to be affected.

The former 2018 FIFA World Cup winner is regarded highly at the club, but there are doubts regarding his quality as a goalkeeper in the Premier League.

Currently, Levy is not able to get any World Class Goalkeeper that is better than Lloris as it seems as though Spurs are happy with what they have in between the posts.

**Worth the Investment?**

He is a decent shot-stopper, although he reacted pretty late and conceded a few goals last season. In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Hugo Lloris made a total of 38 appearances in the Premier League where he started in all those games.

Last season, Lloris made a total of **114 saves,** which is still really good numbers considering the fact that there are looming doubts regarding his overall quality as a goalkeeper for Spurs.

Lloris **conceded** a total of **45 goals** last season, where he also kept **12 clean sheets** in the previous Premier League campaign.

In FPL terms, he scored **149 FPL points** in **38 Premier League appearances**. On an average, he scored **3.91 FPL points per game,** which is equivalent to him making **3-6 saves** in every game.

**Reminder**: 3 saves = 1 FPL point.

There are many other goalkeepers **below £5.5m** who provide numbers almost the same as Lloris does, such as Meslier, Fabianski, Guaita, and Schmeichel.

**Our Opinion?**

If you want to invest **£5.5m** in a Spurs asset, there are defenders in those Spurs ranks that will provide many more FPL points.

Avoid Lloris for the start of the campaign as they have pretty tough fixtures to comply with.

### Defenders

1.  **Reguilon** - **Left-back** - **£5.0m** - Last season, Regulon made a total of 27 Premier League appearances. During that time, he has shown a lot of attacking threat while he was bombarding on the left side for Spurs.

    In 27 appearances, he has a total of 8 clean sheets, but at the same time, he has also conceded a total of 31 goals. The Spanish left-back has really good potential to provide a lot of attacking FPL points.

    **Worth the Investment?**

    While Jose Mourinho was at the club, he was given the license to drift centrally to make things happen from an attacking perspective and supply deliveries for **Son (£10.0m)** and **Kane (£12.5m)**.

    He is pretty decent when it comes to defending and making a tackle or two, but his real threat and value as an FPL asset comes when he attacks, and under Nuno Sspirito Santo, we can expect him to keep providing fantasy points regularly.

    There are **not many** in the £5.0m bracket of defenders that have the potential to provide a lot of FPL points, such as Reguilon does.

    A few notable defenders that are worth investing in are **Tierney, Firpo, Godfrey and Coufal,** who are all in the **£5.0m** bucket.

    **Our Opinion?**

    We don’t see him as a good pick for the opening fixture against Manchester City, but his following fixtures against Wolves, Watford and Crystal Palace are worth considering if you decide to invest in the Spaniard.

2.  **Aurier** - **Right-back** - **£5.0m** - Serge Aurier is owned by 0.6% FPL managers for now. The Ivorian right back has been quite impressive under Mourinho.

    Although, as we have seen in the documentary "All Or Nothing" documentary, Serge Aurier has been criticised a lot for his defensive mistakes. He constantly provides an opportunity for opposition teams to snatch/steal a penalty.

    He is quick and strong. He usually doesn’t allow a defender to get past him, but if they do, he loses his patience and draws a foul in a very testing and freaky area. It can get as freaky as a foul inside the penalty box.

    **Worth the Investment?**

    Last season, Aurier made a total of 19 Premier League appearances in which he kept 6 clean sheets and conceded 21 goals in total. Aerially, he has won about 47.4% of aerial duels.

    At the same time, even though he made a total of 19 Premier League appearances, he scored 2 goals and provided 3 assists during that time.

    In FPL terms, he scored 80 FPL points. On average, he scored 4.21 FPL points per game. Considering those numbers that he has produced, it is pretty decent for a defender making a few appearances.

    **Our Opinion?**

    Avoid the start of the season.

3.  **Doherty** - **Right-back/wing-back** - **£5.0m** - When Daniel Levy decided to appoint Nuno Espirito Santo as the new Tottenham manager, Doherty must have been sitting in his living room having a glass or wine or two.

    With the appointment of Nuno Espirito Santo, Doherty will reunite with his former manager who used to coach him at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Doherty played his best football under Nuno. There was no doubt regarding the amount of Trust Nuno had in Doherty as he deployed him into a system which is very familiar and suitable for the Irish right-back.

    His impressive performances at Wolves earned him a 15 Million move to North London. But his first season at the North London club was not very satisfying.

    However, with the appointment of Nuno, Doherty will get another chance to prove himself as a player who is worthy to wear the jersey of Tottenham Hotspur.

    **Worth the Investment?**

    The Irish right back has consistently proven during his time at Wolves that he is a perfect fit for the system that Nuno deploys.

    During his time at Wolves, he had an eye for goal and he was a real attacking menace on the right-hand side of the attack for Wolverhampton Wanderers. Here are his stats:

    | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2018-19 | 38      | 4     | 3       |
    | 2019-20 | 36      | 4     | 5       |

    In case Doherty gets regular chances at Spurs, he could return similar numbers for the upcoming season. He might even return more since there is a lot more quality for Tottenham in front of goal.

    If this is the case, then we can see the best of Doherty at **£5.0m** as an FPL asset which can be very attractive in case you **cannot afford Son (£10.0m)**.

    But, he has not exploded at all in a Spurs shirt. There are others such as Firpo and Coufal who are worth the **£5.0m** you spend on them.

    **Our Opinion?**

    We need to wait and watch.

4.  **Romero** - **Centre-back** - **(Assumption) £5.0m** - Christian Romero is the most recent signing for Tottenham as they continue their spending splash in the transfer market. He is a centre-back that has contributed immensely to Atalanta’s domestic and European campaigns.

    He is good aerially and also makes multiple vital interceptions. He is not afraid to stick a leg out to get an interception in between. At the same time, he does get a little rusty when he gets his interceptions in.

    He also likes to get in front and dribble as well at times.

    **Is it Worth the Investment?**

    If he comes in at £5.0m, he is still not worth the investment as there are many other options who have much more FPL potential, such as Firpo and Coufal.

    **Our Opinion?**

    Avoid.

5.  **Sanchez**-**Centre-back**-£**4.5m**-The Colombian centre-back has not been able to bring out his best in a Tottenham shirt. He has been struggling for game time all season long and has been out of favour while Mourinho was in charge.

    Under NES, he may get a chance to redeem himself, which is yet to be seen.

    As a defender, he gets in line with the ball and makes multiple blocks that are vital during the course of the game. He also dives into tackles from time to time, which go either way.

    **Our Opinion?**

    He is an established centre-back at club and national level. Wait and see if he is able to get his opportunity with the Spurs.

6.  **Dier**-**Centre-back**-£**4.5m** - Eric Dier started out with a bang during his early days at Tottenham. Over the years, Eric Dier has not really taken that "bang" and made it into a "Big Bang."

    His performances have tailed off significantly. Under Jose Mourinho, he was classified as a centre-back in which he tried to make a significant impact. Although, as we said earlier, he has not been at his best lately.

    As a centre-back, Eric Dier makes multiple blocks time and time again without making them look too rash and aggressive.

    Under Nuno, he might find a new lease on life as a centre-back. Only time will tell.

    **Our Opinion?**

    Avoid or keep him on your bench.

7.  **Davies**-**Centre/Left-back**-£**4.5m**-The Welsh left-back was used as a left-sided centre-back for Spurs at the end of the Premier League season, where he did a pretty decent job.

    With Reguilon in the squad as a left-back, we may see Ben Davies having a role that is more like a centre-back. He may not be used regularly. Many of these Spurs defenders are not guaranteed to have regular game time unless they really impress NES.

    His 2020-21 Premier League season was largely spent on the sidelines as he was injured for most of the campaign as he made just a total of 20 Premier League appearances.

    **Our Opinion?**

    Avoid.

    For all three defenders, Sanchez, Dier, and Davies, there are many alternatives at £4.5m as well, such as Coady, Holding, Ben White, and Ayling, who are certain to get more regular playing time on a constant basis.

### Midfielders

1.  **Son** - **£10.0m** - Heung-Min Son was exceptional under Jose Mourinho and Ryan Mason last season. His burst into a serious goal-scorer came through under Mourinho’s reign at Spurs.

    Heung-Min Son is still at a very attractive price range at **£10.0m**. He is currently owned by **18.8%** of FPL managers worldwide. Last season, in game week 2, against Southampton, Son was an FPL dream that every FPL manager would like to have owned. In that gameweek, he scored 4 goals, which raked up to provide Son with 24 FPL points that week.

    With Harry Kane’s uncertain future at the club, Son is expected to be the main man for Spurs upfront in front of goal. There is no doubt regarding the quality that he has under his belt.

    He has constantly been in the goal scoring charts for Tottenham. Last season, he had **228 FPL points**. At the start of the campaign, he was in sublime form, which could not be taken for granted as he kept providing FPL points on a regular basis and hurt the managers who decided to leave him out in search for another player.

    **Is it Worth the Investment?**

    Even though he is at **£10.0m**, Heung-Min Son is worth the investment as he has found his form very early in the pre-season, scoring against Colchester, MK Dons and Arsenal respectively.

    Early pre-season form is always important before going into an FPL season, as a particular player may help you get a touch above the others. Here are his stats at Tottenham over the years:

    | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2015-16 | 28      | 4     | 1       |
    | 2016-17 | 34      | 14    | 6       |
    | 2017-18 | 37      | 12    | 6       |
    | 2018-19 | 31      | 12    | 6       |
    | 2019-20 | 30      | 11    | 10      |
    | 2020-21 | 37      | 17    | 10      |

    In FPL terms, as mentioned earlier, he has scored **228 FPL points** in **37 Premier League appearances**. On average, he delivered **6.16 FPL points per game** he played, which is a stat that is worth looking at for an FPL asset priced at **£10.0m.**

    **Our Opinion?**

    Consider getting him in from the start, even though they face Manchester City. NES has a pretty good record of upsetting the 2020-21 Premier League champions. His goal scoring stats may just get even better.

2.  **Lucas Moura** - **£6.5m** - The Brazilian winger made a total of 30 appearances last season for the Spurs. Most of them came as substitutes.

    But, NES likes having players that are quick on their feet when their team is on the attack, and this is why we feel that Lucas Moura could be a season-defining FPL player at **£6.5m.**

    He scored 3 goals and provided 4 assists last season despite being used as a substitute.

    **Worth the Investment?**

    He has been a regular feature in the warm-up games for Spurs recently. We are pretty certain that he will have many more opportunities this season to start, which gives FPL managers much more to think about when investing in a **£6.5m** midfielder.

    **Our Opinion?**

    If the Brazilian gets his chances regularly under Nuno, he could be a real FPL asset whose FPL returns may go through the roof as he is a good finisher and provider of the ball as well.

3.  **Dele** - **£6.5m** - Dele Alli is another player who belongs in the same category as his teammate Eric Dier. Dele Alli was another such player who got off to a bright start and tailed off significantly over the last 2-3 seasons.

    According to reports, he had a few misunderstandings with his former boss, which kept him out of the squad for a very long time.

    Having said that, he found his way back into the fold at the end of the campaign last season. Under NES, he might be a good differential player for a few weeks, and then you may have to sell him.

    But, he has been working hard while the Euros were going on and it seems as though he might be itching to get back on the field.

    It seems as though Nuno has big plans for Dele as he has mentioned that he has thought about playing Dele Alli in a much more attacking perspective.

    **Our Opinion?**

    He may still be a bit rusty at the start of the season. Avoid as there are many other FPL options out there for grabs who are guaranteed to provide much higher FPL returns.

4.  **Bergwijn** - **£6.0m** - Steven Bergwijn is another player that is quick on the attack while he is at either side of the wings. He is a player that Nuno prefers.

    Since he signed for Spurs, Bergwijn has got his Spurs career off to a flyer as he scored his debut goal in his debut appearance against Manchester City.

    He is a pretty good poacher of the ball himself and has the audacity to find the net on multiple occasions.

    **Worth the investment?**

    If he gets regular game time week in and week out, he will be worth the investment for a few weeks/months. Those few weeks will be when he hits form and achieves his goals.

    He can take defenders down with his sizzling pace and provide assists regularly as well.

    **Our Opinion?**

    Make sure you catch the bus at the right time.

5.  **Bryan** - **£6.0m** - The Spanish international, who is a recent signing for Spurs, has a lot to offer on the plate.

    The young winger has a lot of talent at his feet and, if Kane is there at Spurs this season, this combination of Bryan Gill and Kane might be the second best duo in the Spurs ranks.

    He is very skillful and dynamic in the way he approaches and plays the game. He takes defenders on and is not afraid to pull out a trick or two.

    However, we feel that it will be a tough start for Bryan Gil at Spurs. However, NES may have other plans. We will have to wait and see.

    Another point worth considering is that Bryan Gill also had an extended run with Spain in the recently concluded Olympics and, as a result, his return to the Spurs side may be delayed longer and we may have to wait even longer for the Spaniard to be on the pitch.

    **Our Opinion?**

    Emile Smith Rowe is a better FPL option at £5.5m.

6.  **Hojbjerg** - **£5.0m** - It will be interesting to see what Nunp does when Hojbjerg returns to the Spurs squad. Last season he was impressive as he had a lot of gas in the tank.

    His extended run in the Euros also added a lot of mileage to his legs. He may be given additional rest by Nuno and his support staff in order for Hojbjerg to gain more rest time in order to get his legs back to full fitness once again.

    Hojbjerg was an attacking midfielder for Denmark at the Euros and it will be interesting to see whether he keeps that defensive role in midfield or whether he ventures much more forward in search of goals.

    **Our Opinion?**

    He might not start the season, but he will come into contention as a potential **5th place FPL midfield asset** with whom you could put him on your bench.

### Forwards

1.  **Kane** - **£12.5m** - Harry Kane is a season keeper-whether he plays for Spurs or Manchester City. He had an unbeatable Premier League season last season where he scored a whopping 23 goals and provided 14 assists as well (which was level with Bruno Fernandes and Jamie Vardy).

    He changed his position on the field during a game where he dropped deep and supplied assists on a regular basis. Kane dropping deep also meant that the others on the wings kept going forward into much more attacking areas, such as Reguilon, Moura and Son. This boosted the appeal of other Spurs FPL assets as well.

    As a centre-forward, he is a clinical finisher in front of the goal as he is able to find the net from any attacking position on the field. Kane was the top scorer when it came to goals from outside the box as well as inside. The man is a killer with goals.

    **Is it Worth the Investment?**

    DEFINITELY!

    As mentioned earlier, he is a player that can not be ignored at any cost. He is a premium asset that is worth it.

    Last season in the FPL, he scored a total of **242 FPL points** in **35 Premier League appearances**. On average, he scored **6.91 FPL points per game played**. Now that is a stat that you can not afford to miss. Here are his stats at Spurs:

    | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2014-15 | 34      | 21    | 4       |
    | 2015-16 | 38      | 25    | 1       |
    | 2016-17 | 30      | 29    | 7       |
    | 2017-18 | 37      | 30    | 2       |
    | 2018-19 | 28      | 17    | 4       |
    | 2019-20 | 29      | 18    | 2       |
    | 2020-21 | 35      | 23    | 14      |

    **Our Opinion?**

    Watch out for Kane this transfer window. Only time will tell whether he moves or stays. At the same time, he also has a history of picking up injuries during the months of November-December.

    But, try keeping him on your bench even if he picks up an injury (Depending on the severity of his injury.)

    If he moves to Manchester City, his minutes might be on the lower side, but his attacking numbers are sure to be impressive.

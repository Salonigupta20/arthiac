The Belgian keeper showed the world once again why he is regarded as one of the best in the business. He made two big saves in the game to deny the visitors to equalise.

He was a huge figure in the box for Los Blancos as he kept the ball well and he was cool, calm and collective. He's hungry to prove people that he belongs right in the race for the best goalkeeper in the world. He was rightfully adjudged as the Man of the Match.

### 2. Ferland Mendy: 7

The left-back was much improved than what he displayed a few days ago against Granada. His passes were much more accurate, safe and pretty confident. Defensively, he was reliable. Read the game pretty well.

### 3. David Alaba: 6.5

The Austrian made a horrendous mistake in the opening few minutes of the game as he mis-read an aerial ball over the top which fell to Inaki Williams who wasted his effort on target.

It was a performance for David Alaba to forget as this was a day where he has hit his lowest in the white jersey of Real Madrid. His stats:

98% Pass completion

3 Interceptions

3 clearances

It seemed like he felt the heat of the fixture and is probably exhausted as well.

### 4. Eder Militao: 8

The Brazilian centre-back also had an off day in the office. He made a few defensive errors which could not be capitalised to the full extent by the visitors.

Real Madrid are known for epic comebacks and the same was shown by Eder Militao. Even though he got off to a poor start in the game, he came back like a lion to tame the lions of the Basque country as he came in and made crucial blocks and interceptions from time to time. His added efforts by putting himself on the line have to be complimented. He should be proud of the way he picked himself up and came back in the game in a good and positive frame of mind.

Effort and Character are the only two things you can control in life and that is why we have rated him for 8 points. His stats:

3 tackles

9 clearances

### 5. Lucas Vazquez: 6.5

The Spaniard has been finding it difficult to get things going in full flow for him at the Bernabeu. It is definitely his lack of game time that is causing issues for him to perform at high standards.

However, he could not really provide a good attacking impact on the right hand side for Los Blancos as he struggled to push forward and focused mainly on defending. Speaking about defending, he made a match winning tackle of the game where he slid in to prevent the ball from going in the net.

He too showed good courage and character even though he isn't able to start on a regular basis. Hats off to Vazquez!

### 6. Toni Kroos: 7.5

The German had yet another outing on the field in which Real Madrid banked on. His presence in midfield was influential even though the team suffered in the second half.

His work rate on the day was much more defensive, which can be understood as Athletic Bilbao had their tails up. He was critical when Real Madrid were on defensive duties as he recovered the ball well and supplied it around. We couldn't see the best of him as he was marked really well.

### 7. Casemiro: 5.5

The poor start to this campaign continues for the Brazilian holding midfielder as he was very silly drawing a lot of fouls and putting a lot of pressure on the Real Madrid backline. He received a booking as well which was extremely careless.

It is clear that he needs a break as he looks mentally and physically exhausted. His stats:

3 clearances

4 tackles

9/10 long ball completion

94% passing accuracy

### 8. Luka Modric: 7.5

The Croatian wasn't at his absolute best today, but he held himself well overall. At the fine age of 36, he is still able to deliver the goods for Real Madrid. He was reliable and secure in his forward passes.

He also made a few fine moves in midfield. He got an assist for the only goal in the game. It was an assist where he looked to smash the ball into the back of the net, but his mis-timed shot ended up at the feet of Benzema, who tapped it home comfortably. He was subbed off later in the game, which was really necessary. His stats:

8/9 long balls

4 key passes

90% passes completed

He is still at the top of his game.

### 9. Vinicius Junior: 8

Vini Jr. was the best player on the field in white in terms of attack. He was on top of his game as he created loads of chances throughout the game, in particular, the first half. He created a total of 6 chances in the first half itself.

It may not be noticed, but the move from Vini Jr. opened up the visitors backline.

The major threat from Los Blancos came in from the left-hand side of Real Madrid's attack. He was unlucky not to get any reward for his performances in a Real Madrid shirt, but the signs are really good for the future of his career and for Real Madrid as well. His stats:

5 Tackles

5 key passes

6 chances created - In the first half

### 10. Karim Benzema: 6.5

Fourth best? Not even in the top 3? Karim Benzema just showed why he deserves to be rewarded a lot more for his performances. The French striker came along and got the only goal of the game as he pounced on loose meat. His goal was the difference between a point and all three points.

His goal has provided Real Madrid all three points which is very important as they have extended their gap to seven points in the La Liga table. Sadly, he drifted away as the game went by as he was unable to handle all the pressure. Just another day off and he will be all good.

### 11. Marco Asensio: 4.5

The Spaniard had a bad day at the office. He was unable to capitalise on a few loose balls in and around the attacking half of Real Madrid. He tested the gloves of the keeper, Unai Simon.

He needs to improve his performances if he looks to have a long term future at Real Madrid. Very poor display from Marco Asensio.

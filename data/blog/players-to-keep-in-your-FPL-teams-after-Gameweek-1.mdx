The deadline for Gameweek 2 is fast approaching and with just above 24 hours left, FPL managers might be hustling for arrivals and departures within their squad.

Gameweek 1 just over a week ago with an average score of 69 FPL points worldwide. It is fair to say that this season, FPL has got off to an electric start and hopefully we can see many more FPL points on offer for our FPL assets on the horizon.

Many of us might have even had a gloomy start to their FPL campaign, but it's never too late. Sometimes, players take time to find their groove and hit their goal-scoring bandwagon.

At the end of the day, we need to ensure that we have players in our squad who can potentially deliver from time to time.

Of course, we can't have everyone we need in our 15-man squad in FPL, but we can always adjust and find a way to structure and bolster our squad with FPL assets that would provide FPL points on a regular basis.

Here are the FPL assets you should keep/buy as the season rumbles on. These are the players who are selected based on form and on the prospect of future FPL points.

1.  **Antonio** - **£7.5m** - The West Ham Centre-forward has earned 13 points in Gameweek 1 as he continued his fine form from pre-season.

    Consequently, he also provided 2 fantasy assists, which were included in his overall points tally.

    Ever since David Moyes arrived at the club, the former England striker has been growing into a much bigger threat in front of goal. His aerial prowess is immaculate as he uses his body to good effect.

    At the same time, even though he is built big, he is still quick on his feet.

    But, as always, one of the aspects of FPL is that it is a game where you need to get players in form on your side, and Antonio is an FPL asset who is in some serious form.

    Yes, he missed his opportunity by putting the ball in the back of the net and, as concerns grow around the London Stadium about who will be the long-term penalty taker for West Ham this season, it would be harsh for David Moyes to take away penalty duties from his starman anytime soon.

    We still believe that Antonio remains at the top of the list to take penalties for the Hammers and the game against Leicester on Sunday has the possibility of getting a goal or two for Antonio.

    Next Fixture: Leicester City (H)

2.  **Raphinha** - **£6.5m** - The Brazilian winger has been poor when Leeds faced Manchester United away from home as he kept performing way below.

    Some may say that his standards slightly dipped in the game against Man Utd because of the presence of the away crowd around him.

    But, without doubt, we still believe that he is going to be one of those that will take this season by storm (the Brazilian storm) as he will just keep getting better and better as the days go by.

    It is certain that if you have him in your team, he will perform and provide FPL points during those weeks when your premium FPL assets may not be performing.

    Marcelo Bielsa will surely iron out the defensive mistakes that Leeds made which were exploited by Paul Pogba (£7.6m) and Bruno Fernandes (£12.1m).

    The game against Everton in gameweek 2 will remain in the minds of Leeds fans as well as a few FPL managers, where the Brazilian drilled a low left-footed shot and beat Pickford in goal for pace.

    If you already have him in your FPL squad, keep faith in him. Once he hits the ground running, he will get FPL points for fun.

    Next Fixture: Everton (H)

3.  **Pogba** - **£7.6m** - The French midfielder grabbed all the headlines across England and France after he put up a world-class performance against rivals Leeds United.

    The French midfielder banked 4 assists within an hour, which provided him with 16 FPL points.

    The French World Cup winner delivered after such a long time as the faithful of those who support the Red Devils were asking and demanding a lot more from the player.

    But, his performance against Leeds certainly raised a lot of eyebrows as he has already signalled that this may be the season where he stamps his authority on this pitch for the Red Devils.

    With Pogba in this sort of form, OGS can not afford to keep him on the bench and it is crucial that the Manchester United manager finds a way to fit him into that playing XI constantly (provided that Pogba remains fit.)

    FPL managers have already got the feeling that Pogba might be back at his best and this has earned the French international many more FPL owners as his FPL value has risen by £0.1m.

    He currently sits in 13.3% of FPL squads so far and his ownership is expected to rise as the deadline for game week 2 approaches.

    If things go well, there is no doubt that the World Cup winner will continue to set high standards for himself this season and if you've got him in your FPL team, we're pretty sure that you'll be on a rollercoaster ride with FPL points coming your way!

    Next Fixture: Southampton (A)

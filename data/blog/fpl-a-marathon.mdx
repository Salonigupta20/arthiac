We were all buzzing before the Premier League season started so that we could get going and take a look
at how our FPL teams would fare in Gameweek 1.

Well, some of us have got off to an electric start in your mini-league, while some have had a decent start and the others? Ummm.... Maybe you guys fell way behind your colleagues at school, university and work.

But, that should not let you down ahead of Gameweek 2, which begins in about 2.5 days.

FPL has always been a marathon in which you compete. Some of you might be athletes. The others here might be street, school, university, or club level players. You know that if you invest all your energy in the 1st phase of the game, you may run out of fuel pretty soon by the end of your sporting objective.

The same concept is applied here in FPL. There is no need to panic so soon right after gameweek 1 has just got over. As the saying goes, "Patience is a Virtue."

With time and strategic planning, you can still catch up with those that are above you in your mini-league and boost your overall ranking. Slow and steady wins the race buddy!

This week, the average FPL score was 69, with the highest gameweek score going to FPL manager "empooo", who tripled Captained Mohamed Salah.

Ahan! I’m guessing that you have a plan to copy the teams that your rivals have in their FPL teams in your mini-league. But, if you look at it, you may have a few players that you can fit into your side.

At the same time, even though you may have the same players as your rival does, it won’t make much difference to your overall rank and position in your mini league.

### Let’s take an example:

Mark, Jonathan, Chris, Tim, Josh, Mitchell, and Joe are 7 FPL managers competing in the same mini-league, but just as the world is all competition, there is a small little contest between Mark and Joe.

Mark started off with a staggering gameweek 1 FPL points tally of 129 and he has topped the mini-league, while Joe is languishing right at the bottom with just 34 FPL points.

That is definitely a horrible start to Joe’s Fantasy Premier League campaign, but it’s not all doom and gloom for Joe. There are still 37 gameweeks left in a football league that promises a lot of highs and lows throughout the 9-10 months of football action that it has to offer for fans and football lovers.

Now,

Let’s just say that Joe manages to get 8-9 players that Mark has in his FPL team and Joe decides to continue with the same team as he feels it is a good strategy to catch up with Mark.

If you look at it mathematically, you may catch up with Mark, but that catch will be in bits and pieces. It will look like you’ve just got crumbs to feed yourself with after all the effort you’ve put in.

Of course, you can place an argument saying that "Joe can get all his captaincy decisions spot on." Of course, he can! But, the probability of that happening is limited.

What Joe can do is alter and tailor a squad that would come from behind and really give Mark a good run for his money and focus on his FPL team and find an opening to get within touching distance of Mark as well as his colleagues in the mini-league. (Just like in the movie Ford v Ferrari or Cars-Lightning McQueen).

Okay, maybe those movies may not exactly demonstrate and explain my whole point, but there’s one thing we all see. The main character always focuses on "their thing." They focus on "their game" and that is exactly how FPL managers should approach the game.

Mark will stumble, he will get his captaincy decisions wrong at some point, he may even feel the heat, he may feel that someone is out there behind him catching up, which may lead him to take hits on his team.

But at the end of the day, you focus on your game. You do your thing. Follow around the net, get a few tips, focus on how and where you want the majority of your points to come from.

As a player, when you face your opposition, you always want to focus on your game as well as your team’s game. Yes, you will look for potential weakness and moments where your opponent may stumble so that you can capitalize on that mistake.

As an athlete, your main aim is to win, but it is of substantial importance that you focus on your posture of your head, shoulder and arms, core engagement, balance and so much more that you will know about while you jog or go for a sprint.

At the end of the day, You are You and Your FPL team can still improve as the season goes by.

Here are a few tips you can consider to look at:

1.  Use and activate your chips wisely.
2.  Make calculated investments in players.
3.  Catch the form of a player (Both scoring and assisting)
4.  For Defenders - Centre-Backs

    - Try looking at the number of times they are able to shut down a scoring opportunity

    - Look at their contribution in defence such as Aerial duels, interceptions and potential goals

5.  For Defenders - Wing-backs/Left or Right-backs

    - Look at whether they are on set-piece duty (Digne, Cresswell)

    - Look at the number of times they get in forward positions to get into goal-scoring positions.

6.  For Midfielders -

    - Look at the positions they take during a game (Defensive/Attacking)
    - Players that take up attacking positions usually have multiple opportunities to provide FPL points.

    - There are many players in that category, but there are a few differentials too

    - Examples: Jack Harrison, Benrahma, Greenwood, Smith Rowe, Sarr, Buendia, Willock, Bowen, Bergwijn and Rashica.

7.  For Attackers -

    - Get those players that are key for their team but are under the radar

    - Focus on those attackers that are also on Penalty duties

    - Examples of players:

      - Wilson

      - Pukki

      - Bamford

      - Saint-Maximin

      - Jimenez (Although we need to wait for a while till he really comes to the party)

      - Wood

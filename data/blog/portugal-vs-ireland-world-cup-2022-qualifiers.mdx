The Portuguese icon and superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, has smashed Ali Daei's record for scoring the most international goals in men's football for Iran during his time on the pitch, but Ronaldo leaped over the Iranian last night as he secured a 2-1 victory for Portugal over the Republic of Ireland in a game that had a lot of thrills and chills for football fans across the world, in particular, the Portuguese fans.

Fernando Santos displayed a star studded lineup which included the likes of Ruben Dias, Joao Cancelo, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva, Diogo Jota, and Cristiano Ronaldo in the playing XI to take on the Irish, who had visited the shores of Portugal to get their first point (s) on board in their conquest to play in next year's FIFA World Cup 2022.

Portugal were aiming to get off to an electric start since kick off. The men in red had most of the positions during the first 15 minutes of the game as they kept asking questions of the Irish defence. However, they were rusty with possession as they gave away the ball needlessly to the Irishmen.

It was the turn of the Irish to get rusty with the ball as a misplaced pass from 19-year old debutant, Gavin Bazunu, drew a rash challenge from Jeff Hendrick on Bruno Fernandes in the penalty box to award a controversial penalty in the 10th minute of the game.

The referee made good use of VAR and replays showed that it was difficult to tell whether Hendrick got the ball or the ankles of the Portuguese midfielder. After spending nearly five minutes on the pitch-side monitor, the penalty was awarded by the Slovenian referee, Matej Jug.

During the course of the ongoing VAR check, Ronaldo kept the ball on the penalty spot and Dara O'Shea kicked the ball away, which resulted in Cristiano lashing an arm at the shoulders of the Irish defender.

The VAR didn't take a look at the incident and there was no action taken against the icon from Madeira.

Speaking of the foul on Bruno Fernandes, this one was clearly a 50-50 challenge from Jeff Hendrick. It appeared that he made contact with the ball, but his follow through caught Bruno Fernandes and that was why the penalty stood.

Well, on the other hand, Bazunu had a dream start to his international career as he got across his right side and put a strong palm to deny Ronaldo from getting his record-breaking goal.

Fernando Santos and his men didn't stop as they raised the bar in search of the opening goal of the game, but the Irish kept their heads held firm and gritted their way into the Portuguese half as they frustrated the Portuguese players and fans alike.

The game grew into a physical battle between the sides as both these teams had collective goals on the line.

The Portuguese ebbed and probed into the Irish defence, but they couldn't get past the last Irishman in line.

The stubborn determination of Stephan Kenny's Irish side caused Portuguese centre-backs Pepe and Ruben Dias a few issues to deal with as Adam Idah and Aaron Connolly found a way past the Portuguese midfield.

As a result, Ireland tried a few long-range shots from outside the box, but none of them put Rui Patricio to test in between the posts.

Portugal kept pushing forward, raising their intensity and expectations of scoring a goal, but they just couldn't find the killer pass at the end. A lot of creativity and skill in the middle of the park for Portugal, but they just couldn't find their way past the Irish defence.

The home fans thought that their team had found a way when Joao Cancelo whipped a delightful delivery from the right wing side of Portugal's attack, which was met by Diogo Jota, but his thunderous header crashed against the bar to deny Portugal the opportunity to take the lead, which led to added frustration for the Portuguese boss.

As you would expect, the fans wanted more from their talented side and Portugal kept hunting and even though the ball fell kindly to the feet of the men in red and green, none of them were able to capitalise and latch on to such an opportunity.

As the first half came to a close, Ireland asked a few questions of the Portuguese in terms of their defensive contributions as they found a few pockets of space to exploit.

Brighton's striker was presented with a glorious opportunity to give Ireland the lead as he found himself 1-on-1 with the goalkeeper, who rushed out and cut the angle and space for Brighton's striker to find the net.

That was just the start of what Ireland had to offer on their trip to the Algarve. A minute later, the Irish had a corner from which they could use the likes of Shane Duffy and John Egan's physical presence to good effect.

On that note, John Egan leaped in front across the Portuguese defence line and glanced his header perfectly into the back of the net, beyond the reach of Rui Patricio, who stood up to record his 1st international goal, and the Irish boys took a shocking lead just before half-time.

Just at the stroke of half-time, Portugal found an opening to score as Jota took an aim at goal, which was straight at Bazunu, who claimed the ball after spilling it initially, and the men in red and green couldn't find the back of the net.

The second half got underway in similar fashion as Portugal kept hunting for an equalizing goal to keep them in the game, but Ireland were heroic as they put their bodies on the line to deny every sniff that Portugal had on goal.

Bruno Fernandes tried to pull out a trick from his bag of skills, but it wasn't meant to be for the Manchester United midfielder.

Ireland came again with a golden opportunity to make it 2-0 by the hour mark, but Connolly couldn't find the back of the net on this occasion, as it felt that the Irish would walk away with 3 points where they had spent the majority of their time contributing to the defensive aspect of their game.

Ronaldo got a few opportunities as well to capitalize on, but the signs indicated that it just wasn't his day as he had an attempt on goal with his head, left foot, and right foot as well, but none of them seemed to go in as the Irish kept the Portuguese superstar at bay.

Every cross and attempt at goal from Portugal couldn't find its way past the Irish defenders into the net.

Bernardo Silva was provided with a golden opportunity in front of the goal as a whipping cross from Cristiano found its way to the Manchester City winger, who scooped the ball over the bar as the Portuguese night grew old and frail.

Just as the Portuguese night grew older, Goncalo Guedes found a cross right on the head of Ronaldo and he slotted it home past Bazunu's left hand side to give Portugal the equaliser as the crowd roared back into action just as Cristiano had asked them to raise their voices.

That headed finish marked his record-breaking **110th international goal** in Portuguese colours as he surpassed the record that Ali Daei had kept with him for several years which stood at 109.

Oh boy, Ronaldo was pumped, the adrenaline kept pumping around the stadium and the fans knew that the man was still in his locker at the fine age of 36.

There was a sense that Portugal could get the winning goal too. Every attempt by Portugal kept the Irish fans biting their fingernails for dinner. (I guess.)

Five stoppage minutes were put up on the board and the game had been extended due to stoppage in play. As a result, the game continued slightly beyond the fifth minute mark.

Portugal kept going, they kept pushing and up stepped the Man-The Myth-The Legend: **Cristiano Ronaldo.**

Once again, the boy from Madeira leaped high and scored his **111th international goal**, which sparked seismic waves across the internet as Ronaldo grabbed all the headlines.

That goal would certainly give us goosebumps as Cristiano Ronaldo proved once again that he refuses to be downcast, he refuses to drop his head, he refuses to go home with a bent shoulder, but the man has proven that he is a legend of the game.

## Speaking about Cristiano Ronaldoâ€¦.

The man is certainly the most clutch player in history. He has saved Portugal from defeat, not once or twice or thrice.

The man is a hell of a machine and he has delivered on the international stage time and time and time again.

You have run out of superlatives for Cristiano Ronaldo!

During his time at Real Madrid, when Benzema and Bale were in their prime, they were out injured and Ronaldo was the only one up top for Real Madrid.

The Spanish newspapers headlined him "Finished" after he failed to deliver in an away game.

Since he turned 30, the numbers that Ronaldo has put up in front of the goal are staggering.

He is truly a goal machine.

The Portuguese superstar is **36** now and since he turned **30**, he has scored **320 goals**.

With all due respect, those are numbers that you and I can't even dream of. Impeccable from Cristiano Ronaldo!

He has aged like a fine wine. He adapted his game, changed his position in front of the goal and he has still found a way to succeed at the highest level.

Three years ago, once again, people said that the guy was finished as he took a backward step in his career by signing for Juventus at the age of 33.

And Guess what???

In just over 3 years, Ronaldo scored **101 goals** in **134 games** for the Bionconneri, as he took **131** games to score a **ton of goals** for the Old Lady in Turin.

## Cristiano Ronaldo since turning 30

| AGE | GOALS | AVERAGE |
| --- | ----- | ------- |
| 30  | 58    | 1.04    |
| 31  | 54    | 0.93    |
| 32  | 53    | 0.90    |
| 33  | 49    | 0.91    |
| 34  | 45    | 0.90    |
| 35  | 40    | 0.83    |
| 36  | 21    | 0.68    |

**Does he have anything yet to prove?** Hell No!

Those stats show that he has nothing yet to prove, but he keeps going the extra mile because he loves breaking records.

Pure Passion, Determination, and Courage are what it takes to be successful at the highest level!

There are no boundaries to "greatness" for CR7!

To add to that, he is going back to England at the age of 36, which is the toughest league among all.

That just shows that Cristiano Ronaldo has "Unfinished Business" and he isn't done just yet!!!

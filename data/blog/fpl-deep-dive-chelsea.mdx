We go back to the capital city of London, i.e, Well, to be precise, we’re going to West London. Chelsea have put themselves back among the big boys this last campaign, where their season was divided into two that the Chelsea fans and Premier League followers could see.

At the start of the 2020-21 Premier League campaign, former Chelsea captain, Frank Lampard, had his first full season with the Chelsea first team in West London. Roman Abramovic had invested a sizable amount of funds into the Chelsea first-team squad that would strengthen their side, which would take them to the next-level in domestic and European football as well.

This investment brought about big-money signings that had seen Chelsea spend big in the transfer market by bringing the likes of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell, Edouard Mendy and veteran defender Thiago Silva.

In financial terms, these players cost above £292m as Chelsea broke the bank more than their counterparts had done.

But, things did not progress well with Frank Lampard at Chelsea. The sacking of Frank Lampard came after a poor run of form where Lampard could get just 2 wins from the last 8 league matches. This string of poor results and league position saw Roman Abramovich push the Red button on the managerial services of Frank Lampard by the end of January 2021.

Thomas Tuchel was appointed immediately as Lampard’s replacement and things got off to a pretty decent start.

As always, in this article, we look into every department that "The Blues" have to offer for FPL managers around the world who would want to consider a potential opening for Chelsea asset (s) to enter their FPL teams.

## Chelsea in 2020-21

---

The arrival of Thomas Tuchel was an appointment that added a glimmer of hope to the Chelsea fans as they started notching up victories from time to time that would boost their position to play European football next season.

Thomas Tuchel’s first game in charge of Chelsea was the 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 27th January, 2021.

Thomas Tuchel took his Chelsea side on an unbeaten streak of 13 matches, which has never been done before. He was the first manager to break Luiz Felipe Scolari’s record of 12 games unbeaten.

There were a few downfalls, especially the 5-2 defeat of West Bromwich Albion, where Chelsea were down to 10 men after Thiago Silva was sent off.

But this didn’t stop Chelsea from progressing. They made it to the final four by finishing 4th in the league table after Leicester City had slipped up to Spurs in the final league game of the 2020-21 season.

The Blues went on to achieve greater accolades as they bossed the pitch in Porto, Portugal as they won the 2nd Champions League title after a 1-0 win over Pep Guardiola’s star-studded Manchester City.

## What to Expect from Chelsea in the FPL?

---

With Chelsea, there are multiple options to consider as Thomas Tuchel prefers rotating his starting XI on a regular basis, including the goalkeeper.

Thomas Tuchel follows the typical German style of football approach with a high press and an attacking style of play.

This presents a really good opportunity for FPL managers to get points from these Chelsea assets in the 2021-22 Premier League.

The Blues are strong and compact defensively, even as Tuchel uses a 3-4-3 or a 3-5-2 formation. Last season, after the arrival of Tuchel, Chelsea’s primary men in defence were a mixed blend of personnel that included Edouard Mendy, Rudiger, Thiago Silva, Christensen, and Azpilicueta.

## Players as "Potential" Regular Starters

---

### Goalkeeper

1. **Edouard Mendy** - £**6.0m** - The Senegalese shot-stopper was bought at a price-tag of £22m from French Ligue 1 club Lille on a 5-year deal. He has arguably been Chelsea’s number 1 in between the posts as he had taken over the reigns of Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was Chelsea’s record signing in 2018 for £71m.

   Mendy has been very reliable for Chelsea, keeping a number of clean sheets along with penalty saves. He has also kept multiple clean sheets against Manchester City in the Premier League as well as in the Champions League.

   In the 2020-21 Premier League season, he made 31 appearances for Chelsea and kept a total of 16 clean sheets where he conceded 0.75 goals per 90 minutes on average.

   **Our Opinion?** - If you invest £6.0m in Mendy, have a regular back-up goalkeeper at the FPL price-tag of £4.5m just in case, as Mendy will be benched at times.

### Defenders

1. **Rudiger** - **Centre-back** - £**5.5m** - Antonio Rudiger was below the pecking order under Frank Lampard as he fell out of the manager’s favour. Since the arrival of Tuchel, Rudiger has found a new lease on life and has been a pillar in Chelsea’s defence.

   During Chelsea’s semi-final clash with Real Madrid in the Champions League, Rudiger was involved in a collision where he sustained a facial injury.

   He continued to carry on playing by wearing a facial mask and showed real courage and determination to defend.

   In set-pieces, Rudiger is among the primary target-men that Chilwell and Mount will aim for during set-pieces. He has goals under his belt and, if he gets into his groove, he is set to be one of Chelsea’s high-scoring defenders.

2. **Azpilicueta** - **Centre-back** - £**6.0m** - He is currently owned by 3.5% of FPL managers. At £6.0m, he is a bit too expensive to consider in your FPL teams.

   Last season, he provided a total of 113 FPL points at a £5.5m price tag. Azpilicueta was a player who was a differential that a few had piled up on by the end of the 2020-21 campaign.

   Along with his Chelsea teammates, he provided a "guaranteed" 6-pointer on a regular basis, with the odd goal and an assist arriving from the Spaniard. Below are his Premier League numbers:

   | Season <br /> Premier League | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ---------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2015-16                      | 37      | 2     | 3       |
   | 2016-17                      | 38      | 1     | 4       |
   | 2017-18                      | 37      | 2     | 6       |
   | 2018-19                      | 38      | 1     | 5       |
   | 2019-20                      | 36      | 2     | 6       |
   | 2020-21                      | 26      | 1     | 2       |

   César Azpilicueta provides decent numbers regularly, both defensively and from an attacking point of view too.

   **Our Opinion? -** He may be a £0.5m expensive, but, watch out for his regularity in the starting XI.

3. **Ben Chilwell** - **Left-wingback** - £**6.0m** - Ben Chilwell got off to a flyer at Chelsea when he made his debut under Frank Lampard by scoring a goal in his debut game itself. He was the prime candidate for Frank Lampard and was a regular starter ever since Tuchel arrived.

   Under Tuchel, he has found it relatively hard to find himself in the starting XI as he faces competition from Marcos Alonso, who is also fighting for his place in the playing XI.

   Though Chilwell was England’s 2nd choice left-back at the Euro’s, he still has a lot of creativity in his play while he is on the attack from the wings.

   In the 2020-21 Premier League season, he registered a total of 139 FPL points along with 11 bonus points.

   He cruises through the opposition penalty-box from time to time and he is not afraid to have a crack at goal himself. He also shows a good work ethic in the defensive and attacking aspects of his game. However, we must say that he prefers to go forward.

   At Leicester, he was an essential part of their attacking moves. He got off to a decent start at the start of his Leicester City career. But, he kicked on really well in the 2019-20 Premier League season. Here are the numbers from his time at Leicester and Chelsea:

   | Season <br /> Premier League | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ---------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2017-18                      | 24      | 0     | 2       |
   | 2018-19                      | 36      | 0     | 4       |
   | 2019-20                      | 27      | 3     | 3       |
   | 2020-21                      | 27      | 3     | 5       |

4. **James** - **Right-wingback** - £**5.5m** - Reece James is still on the rise in FPL terms. He may have a small sample size to begin with, but, if he gets his opportunities regularly, he could be a really good fantasy asset for FPL managers to consider.

   Reece James has come through the ranks at Chelsea and has made his way through the Chelsea first team squad.

   He is quick, physically strong and on set piece duty as well as on a timely basis. While he is on the attack, he delivers venomous deliveries across the 6-yard box that may catch defenders off guard.

   Below are his numbers:

   | Season <br /> Premier League | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ---------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2019-20                      | 24      | 0     | 2       |
   | 2020-21                      | 32      | 1     | 2       |

   Tuchel provides him with a wing-back role, which gives him the license to go forward and provide attacking returns as well. He also shows a good work ethic with discipline as well.

   **Our Opinion? -** Watch out for the opportunities he gets as well as the minutes he plays.

5. **Kounde** - **Centre-back** - **(Assumption - £5.0m)** - Jules Kounde is nearly set to join Chelsea in a potential swap deal that would involve Kurt Zouma, who would go to Sevilla in Spain.

   With this signing, Chelsea have seriously strengthened their defensive line, which makes an investment in their defence much more guaranteed FPL points provider in their defence line.

   Kounde is already a serial winner after he won the Europa League in the 2019-20 season, where they defeated Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan 3-2. Kounde has already made his way into the French National Team start-studded set-up at a very young age.

   He recently represented France in EURO 2020.

   Here are his stats below:

   | Season <br /> La Liga (Spain) | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2019-20                       | 29      | 1     | 1       |
   | 2020-21                       | 34      | 2     | 1       |

   At the age of 21, Jules Kounde won his first trophy in club terms. That was apparently his debut season at Sevilla. He has also represented Sevilla in the Europa League, where he featured in 9 games up to the final.

   His numbers are appealing for a youngster at 22 years old, even though he has played in Spain. Spanish football demands high levels of concentration along with skillful defending.

   He comes up with timely tackles on a regular basis. He is quick, agile and physically strong enough to cope with the heat and demands of the Premier League.

   A jump to the Premier League is a stepping stone in the bright future of Jules Kounde.

   The only question that remains is **"Who do I (you) pick from Chelsea’s defence?"** (We will cover that for you as you scroll through the article)

   **Our Opinion? -** He might be used as an undercover study by Cesar Azpilicueta or Thiago Silva this season. With Kurt Zouma leaving, Kounde is sure to get his chance. When he gets his opportunities, make sure you’re at the station to catch his train! There are potential good points coming in!

### Who do I (you) pick from Chelsea’s defence?

The answer lies within the structure of your FPL team.

- If you want the added benefit of your defence providing added points, opt for **Chilwell (£6.0m)**, **Azpilicueta (£6.0m) or Reece James (£5.5m)**. There is an element of risk on the Chelsea side, but you always have a backup defender who starts in case your Chelsea assets don’t make it.

- **Rudiger (£5.5m)** is an investment worth making as he is a central figure in the Chelsea back-line as he may get more minutes.

- Chelsea’s goalkeeper, **Edouard Mendy (£6.0m),** is the safest bet among Chelsea defenders.

### Midfielders

1. **Jorginho - £6.0m** - Jorginho is available in the FPL game for £6.0m. At his price tag, you could debate his potential to provide points.

   He is at the heart of Chelsea’s midfield along with N’Golo Kante (£5.0m). Jorginho is a midfielder that provides assists on a regular basis. He is dynamic and creative in his own way.

   He is Chelsea’s prime candidate for penalties and he has a very good record of scoring them. During his time at Chelsea, Jorginho has taken 18 penalties for Chelsea and missed just 3. Consequently, all those 3 penalty misses came last season against Arsenal, Liverpool and Krasnodar.

   Either way, he is once again set to be the main man to bury penalties when the opportunity comes by.

   **Our Opinion? -** He is a bit too expensive by £0.5m. However, he is sure to get multiple chances to slot a few penalties home as Chelsea are very quick in transition when they are on the attack.

2. **Mount - £7.5m** - Mason Mount came into the spotlight under Frank Lampard. He was Lampard’s go-to man in midfield every single week at Chelsea. Having said that, Chelsea loaned out Mount to Derby County and this was where the pair spent time together while they were at the club with Lampard as the head coach in the 2018-19 Championship season.

   It was at Derby County where Mason Mount exploded onto the scene, where he provided 4 assists along with 9 goals.

   The following 2019-20 season, Mount was a regular first-team player and he continued to be Tuchel’s number one in midfield. Mount lies at the heart of Chelsea’s "creativity" in front of goal, as he is more than capable of finding the killer pass to set a runner free through goal.

   Here are his stats:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2016-17 | 24      | 4     | 5       |
   | 2017-18 | 30      | 3     | 8       |

   **Our Opinion? -** Find a way to get him into your FPL teams.

3. **Havertz** - £**8.5m** - After being the star man at Bayer Leverkusen for a total of 4 seasons, Chelsea spent a whopping £70 million to purchase the services of the German international.

   It was a quiet start for the German as he struggled to find his rhythm in the Premier League. By the end of the 2020-21 campaign, Havertz found his groove as he was phenomenal in the game against Crystal Palace, where he scored and assisted 1 each.

   In the FPL, at £8.5m, he is tipped to start the new season on a high as he begins training with Chelsea ahead of the new season.

   With Chelsea struggling to find goals up front, Havertz is the key to unlocking Chelsea’s goal-scoring potential. Below are his stats from his time at Bayer Leverkusen and Chelsea domestically:

   | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2016-17 <br /> Bundesliga     | 24      | 4     | 5       |
   | 2017-18 <br /> Bundesliga     | 30      | 3     | 8       |
   | 2018-19 <br /> Bundesliga     | 34      | 17    | 3       |
   | 2019-20 <br /> Bundesliga     | 30      | 12    | 6       |
   | 2020-21 <br /> Premier League | 27      | 4     | 3       |

   These numbers will keep getting better for young Kai Havertz as he is set to have a main role at Chelsea this season. His major goal for Chelsea so far has been in the Champions League final against Manchester City in May 2021.

   **Our Opinion? - Havertz** gets into many attacking positions compared to Mount. This gives FPL managers a much better opportunity to gain more FPL points and bonus points too.

4. **Pulisic** - £**8.0m** - Christian Pulisic is a much more experienced Premier League campaigner at Chelsea. His breakthrough season at Chelsea was quite remarkable considering the number of games and minutes he had on the pitch.

   He brings a lot of skill and pace to the table for Chelsea as they will look to his services to chip in with goals this season.

   Pulisic has the ability to score 15-20 Premier League goals a season with the talent he has. Unfortunately, injuries have kept him out on a regular basis and the progress of the bright American international has been kept under the shadows.

   Below are his domestic stats:

   | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2016-17 <br /> Bundesliga     | 29      | 3     | 6       |
   | 2017-18 <br /> Bundesliga     | 32      | 4     | 5       |
   | 2018-19 <br /> Bundesliga     | 20      | 4     | 4       |
   | 2019-20 <br /> Premier League | 25      | 9     | 4       |
   | 2020-21 <br /> Premier League | 27      | 4     | 2       |

   **Our Opinion? -** Look at the amount of minutes he has played this season. If he finds his scoring boots, try to find a spot for him.

### Forwards

1. **Werner - £9.0m** - With Giroud being shown the exit door and Tammy Abraham set to be next in line to leave the club, Timo Werner is all that Chelsea have in attack as a centre-forward.

   Werner was a part of Chelsea’s big summer transfer splash as Chelsea acquired his services from RB Leipzig for around £50 million.

   A lot was expected out of Timo Werner, as many had suggested that he would hit the ground running from the start of the 2020-21 campaign. But, things have not gone to plan for the German international.

   A drought in front of goal questioned his selection in Chelsea’s starting XI. But, Thomas Tuchel was adamant and stuck with Timo Werner, suggesting that Werner stretches opposition defenders with his pace as he also brings a lot more to Chelsea’s attack.

   Here are his stats domestically in Germany and England:

   | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2016-17 <br /> Bundesliga     | 31      | 21    | 5       |
   | 2017-18 <br /> Bundesliga     | 32      | 13    | 7       |
   | 2018-19 <br /> Bundesliga     | 30      | 16    | 7       |
   | 2019-20 <br /> Bundesliga     | 34      | 28    | 8       |
   | 2020-21 <br /> Premier League | 35      | 6     | 8       |

   **Our Opinion?** - We believe that his goal-scoring form will be back sooner rather than later. His numbers suggest that he can really hit the ground running when things go his way. He has lacked a little bit of cutting edge since his arrival at Chelsea, but he is bound to be on a goal-scoring streak pretty soon. Don’t miss that flight!

Manchester City took on a Leeds side who know no boundaries under Marcelo Bielsa. The Argentine has drilled his men to arguably be the fittest side in the Premier League this season after their promotion. It is safe to say that Pep Guardiola's main objective this season is to go for Glory in the Champions League, a title which the blue side of Manchester doesn’t have in their Illustrious trophy cabinet which showcases a lot of recent success.

That objective of Champions League glory leads Pep to make seven changes to their main lineup. Man City began the game well by having a lot of possession, but, Raphinha was Leeds’ brightest on the lush green carpet of the Etihad in the 1st half, although, Stuart Dallas emerged out of the Yorkshire pack to drill the ball along the turf to give Leeds the opener in the 43rd minute which was their first attempt on goal during the entire 1st half.

Two and a half minutes later, Liam Cooper was sent off for Serious Foul Play for a challenge on Gabriel Jesus by the referee Andre Marriner. Leeds were down to 10 men for the entire 2nd half. Man City kept pushing and knocking at the door and they eventually found a way through the stubborn defence of Leeds through Ferran Torres in the 76th minute.

With 15 odd minutes left to play, Man City raised a gear to get the 3 points, but, Raphinha unleashed the spring in his boots to get 1 on 1 with Ederson who snatched the ball away from his Brazilian counterpart. Minutes later, Stuart Dallas sprinted clear from midfield leaving behind Stones and Fernandinho to score the winner to give Marcelo Bielsa 3 valuable points away from home. Kalvin Philipps was a central figure for Leeds whose efforts at the middle of the park could not be ignored.

Man City sit at 74 points out of 32 games played who still require 11 more points to secure their Premier League title with their rivals Man United reeling behind at 2nd place with 60 points out of 30 games played. Man City cannot afford a slip up at this stage of the season which may cost them their season objectives.

Leeds on the other hand, don’t settle for anything less than the 3 points available and Marcelo Bielsa has his side get into the top half of the Premier League table with plenty to play for. The Leeds faithful will be over the moon as this is a story to testify for years to come.

### 1. Edouard Mendy: 6

He was just warming up running around in his own penalty box in both halves of the game.

He was not given some peace while warming up as Chelsea's defence was pretty rusty in Sweden.

### 2. Antonio Rudiger: 7

Amid all the speculation regarding his contract renewal at Chelsea, Rudiger has not shown any signs of that affecting him and he did well to contain the Malmo attack.

The German was strong aerially as well.

### 3. Thiago Silva: 6.5

The veteran defender was calm and collective during the game with his passing. Received a yellow card in the second half for a pretty reckless challenge.

### 4. Andreas Christensen: 7

The Danish defender was striding forward on a regular basis.

He had a few attempts on target as well. He wasn't troubled much by the Malmo attack. Dealt with the challenges thrown at him with relative ease.

### 5. Cesar Azpilicueta: 6

He was Chelsea's captain on the day and the Spanish defender played in an attacking position in the game. He had Chelsea's first attempt on target.

He tested the palms of the Malmo keeper on several occasions.

He wasn't at his best tonight, but he did decently well.

### 6. Loftus-Cheek: 7.5

He got an opportunity to impress Thomas Tuchel and try to find a way to find a regular starting spot in a Chelsea midfield that is stacked with a lot of quality.

He had one moment in the first half where he controlled the ball well and found a delightful pass onto Ziyech.

He had a pretty good game, although he may have wanted to do much better after making his first start for Chelsea in the Champions League since 2015.

### 7. Jorginho: 6

As usual, the Italian was bossing around in midfield as he picked out his teammates for fun.

### 8. Marcos Alonso: 5.5

He linked up pretty well with Hudson-Odoi in the opening exchanges of the game. He could've done better when he had an attempt on target with 10 minutes left on the clock for half time.

He was a bit rusty on the left-hand side of Chelsea's attack and he lacked confidence while he was on the ball.

### 9. Hakim Ziyech: 7.5

Started the game decently and he nearly put the Blues in front in the opening 15 minutes of the game.

Had a few downs in the opening 45 minutes of the game as he was unable to get his passes underway.

He was also rusty just as his teammates were, but he got the all important goal to seal all 3 points.

### 10. Hudson-Odoi: 8

Started pretty well by using his pace and skill down the left wings.

In the second half, he swapped wings with Ziyech to cause much more threat and he has to be given credit for his delightful assist.

A good day in the office for the youngster.

### 11. Kai Havertz: 6.5

The German started the game playing in the number 9 position in the game, but he kept drifting across the 18-yard box and looked to create a new pathway for Chelsea to breach the Malmo defence.

Had a chance to give Chelsea the lead just before the half-hour mark, but he delayed his attempt on goal.

His best moment in the game came along when he linked up really well with Hudson-Odoi as he set the winger free with a sublime pass out of a tight spot.

Showing signs of marginal improvement taking that number 9 role in place of Lukaku.

## Substitutes

### 12. Ross Barkley: 5

Did well when he came on. Strung a few good passes.

### 13. Christian Pulisic: 5.5

The American winger got a few minutes under his belt after a long injury lay-off.

He will be disappointed that he couldn't make the most of his one-on-one opportunity in front of goal during the dying seconds of the second half.

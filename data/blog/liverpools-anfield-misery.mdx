Liverpool’s 2-0 loss to their bitter derby rivals Everton is their fourth successive premier league loss at Anfield, which is their worst ever run since 1923. Adding to those miserable records, it’s the first time Liverpool has lost to Everton at Anfield since 1999. The Mersey-side was blue as Seamus Coleman was the only Everton player that was a part of the Everton team that beat Liverpool back in 2010.

Burnley arrived at the home of the 2019-20 Premier League champions and ended Liverpool’s unbeaten 64-game home run, which lasted for over 3 years, 6 months and 29 days. Brighton, Man City and Everton have turned Liverpool’s fortress into their nightmare.

Liverpool have been battered by injuries, with Jordan Henderson adding to the injury cart midway through the season. Liverpool have had 17 different defensive pairings this season with only 25 games into the season. Van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Joel Matip, and Fabinho are a few of the key absentees that Liverpool dearly miss in that backline.

A commanding performance against RB Leipzig in the Champions League was a sign that Liverpool could be returning to their best, but it’s just not happening for the Reds in the Premier League. Goals have dried up for Liverpool as they’ve managed to score just two goals in the last four matches at Anfield. Liverpool’s front three haven’t been prolific in front of goal, although opportunities keep knocking at their front door. Salah stands out with 17 goals and 3 assists amongst his fellow forwards, Firmino and Mane.

All said and done, there is no space for Jurgen Klopp and his men to ponder on as Chelsea, Fulham and RB Leipzig are the upcoming visitors to Anfield. Liverpool currently sit in 6th in the Premier League table, which is not the ideal position for the Champions to be in.

With a frail defence, Liverpool need their front line to fire on all cylinders to keep their hopes of a top-four finish intact and secure a Champions League spot for next season. Liverpool certainly have the appetite to change things around, although it is only a matter of time for the champions.

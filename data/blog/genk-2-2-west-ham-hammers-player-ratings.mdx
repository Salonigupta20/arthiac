### 1. Alphonse Areola: 6

The keeper made a few important saves in the first-half to keep West Ham in the charge. He probably could've done better for the second goal conceded, but can't really blame him as the unfortunate header from Soucek arrived really quick.

### 2. Vladimir Coufal: 6.5

The Czech right back made his first start after returning from injury. He was pretty impressive as he demonstrated hard work and resilience.

However, he played a good part to get West Ham in the game as his fine run down the right wing and his well-weighted pass onto Benrahma brought hope and added energy into the Hammers side.

### 3. Craig Dawson: 5.5

The veteran centre back looked to keep his side in the game as much as he could by rallying his troops to raise the performance standards.

Took a booking in the second half and nearly found the net later on.

### 4. Issa Diop: 4.5

The defender had a bad day on foreign soil as he gave away possession on multiple occasions.

He probably could've done better in containing Paintsil's goal.

### 5. Aaron Cresswell: 6

The left back also had a poor first half by his standards, but he looked to venture forward in the second half on multiple occasions.

He nearly found the winning assist in the dying minutes of stoppage time, but his delivery lacked pace.

### 6. Mark Noble: 4.5

The veteran couldn't keep up to the pace of the game and gave away possession quite easily.

### 7. Declan Rice: 5.5

The highly-spoken defensive midfielder began the game off his usual standards, but grew later on in the game.

During the final seconds of the second half stoppage time, he combined well with Kral and Coufal, but unfortunately, that beautiful move didn't lead to a winning goal.

### 8. Arthur Masuaku: 4

He had a really poor game on Thursday night. His movements blocked Cresswell and he couldn't link up well with his teammates.

### 9. Said Benrahma: 8

The Algerian winger was the bright spark for the Hammers, although he was poor in the first half of the game looking to pull out many skills off his Algerian hat.

His second half goal was one to look at as he emerged out in front of his marker and had enough power behind his shot to get past the Genk keeper.

That goal brought the best out of the Algerian as his second goal was one for the Hammers fans to savour upon. Brilliant skill and finesse in his attempt on target.

### 10. Manuel Lanzini: 5

He too, had a poor game as he couldn't really gel well with Antonio and Benrahma.

However, he must be given credit for his pass to Coufal in the build up to the equalising goal for the Hammers.

### 11. Michail Antonio: 4

The Jamaican striker couldn't stamp his authority in the game and was substituted just before the hour mark.

## Substitutes

### 12. Tomas Soucek: 5

He was clearly unfortunate when he conceded the own goal, but he provided a really good base in front of the back four which allowed Declan Rice to push forward and attack.

### 13. Pablo Fornals: 6

The attacking midfielder came on and performed in top gear with a lot of energy up and down the field.

### 14. Jarrod Bowen: 5

As always, the attacking winger provided much greater threat on the right-hand side of West Ham's attack. He nearly got an assist when he delivered a cross onto Craig Dawson.

### 15. Alex Kral: N/A

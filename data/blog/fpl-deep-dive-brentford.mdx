Newcomers Brentford have made their way to the Premier League after a long absence from Top-Tier football. Brentford's "seven-decade" absence from Top-Tier English football came to an end when they won 2-0 against Swansea City in the Championship play-off final, which had secured their first ever Premier League appearance. In front of a crowd of about 12,000 at the iconic Wembley Stadium in North London, the Bees ended a string of nine consecutive play-off failures over the last 30 years and ended a 74-year hiatus from the top division.

Brentford, nicknamed "The Bees", became the 50th club to compete in the Premier League since its debut in 1992-93 as they qualified for the 2021-22 season after they stung Swansea City 2-0, which is a milestone in itself. The latest downfall for the Bees came in the 2019-20 season when Fulham’s Joe Bryan scored two in the second-half of Extra Time to send Fulham to the 2020-21 Premier League season.

Ivan Toney's early penalty and Emiliano Marcondes' close-range finish inside the first quarter of the first half gave the Bees an early two-goal lead, which they never looked like surrendering easily. Financially, this is arguably the richest game in world football. Winning the Championship Play-Off Final is worth a minimum of £170m, which is more than what you could get for winning the Champions League final.

Thomas Frank, the Danish Manager of the Bees, has much more to look forward to in a few weeks as he and his men take on the big boys such as Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United, among a few.

## What we have seen and what can we expect from the Bees?

Brentford finished their Championship campaign in third, which made them take a slightly longer route to the Championship final, which they eventually leaped over. Their end-of-season campaign ended on a strong note as they recorded a 5-0 win over Preston North End, followed by 4 consecutive victories.

This goes to show that the Bees have what it takes to have an impressive campaign under Thomas Frank, especially when they have a few big hitters in their team. They’ve got courage, determination, zeal and, most importantly, they’ve got "quality" in the players that they have to go ahead and have a really convincing Premier League 2021-22 season.

## Players as Potential "Regular" Starters

### Goalkeeper

1. **Raya** – **£4.5m** – David Raya has arguably been Brentford’s number 1 in goal throughout the Championship and he is well set to be the man in goal for Brentford in the upcoming 2021-22 Premier League season. He started in almost every championship game last season and there is no reason to doubt that he will be a regular starter.

   He is a forward-pressing goalkeeper who’ll charge at you if and when he feels that he needs to get closer to the opposition. Additionally, he is a reliable shot-stopper. He also has the ability to come in and make a last-ditch save.

### Defenders

1. **Pinnock** – **Centre-back** – **£4.5m** – His performances during the Championship have been phenomenal in front of David Raya. He has been reliable and commanding in the air. His performance in the Championship Final vs Swansea is one to look at if you have a lingering doubt about him.

   He won the aerial duels time and time again when Swansea City really pushed for a goal or two in the last 20 minutes of the game. His strength is his positioning and awareness of the game. He’s there just when the team needs him.

2. **Ajer** – **Centre-back** – **£4.5m** – Kristoffer Ajer is the second new signing for the Bees this summer as he secured an initial £13.5m move from Celtic in the Scottish Premiership. He was a top target for many clubs around Europe, notably Bayer Leverkusen, AC Milan and Norwich City, but the Bees have secured his services on a five-year-deal.

   Thomas Frank has been full of praise for his new signing by stating that Ajer fits the way Brentford want to recruit players and work with them. Ajer is a centre-back who can be decisive at both ends of the field. He is also very good in the air, winning defensive duels and this can transform into a goal-scoring threat as well. Additionally, he is very comfortable with the ball at his feet.

### Midfielders

1. **Jensen** – **£5.5m** – There is much to like about Mathias Jensen in this Brentford team. He made 35 appearances for the Bees in the Championship last season. He has the potential to provide decisive passes which could help FPL managers to get assists if he really hits his groove. He is also among those who are on set-piece duty, which further raises his assist appeal.

2. **Canos** – **£5.5m** – Sergi Canos is a Spanish wide-winger who is classified as a midfielder in FPL. This is a really good opportunity for FPL managers to get a major differential in the winger who currently sits in just 0.4% of teams.

   A quick and agile winger who has the ability to play in multiple attacking roles during the course of the game. He makes a very strong appeal to FPL managers to have him in their teams.

   In the Championship last season, he scored 9 goals and provided 8 assists to provide a helping hand in securing Brentford’s Premier League status.

3. **Mbeumo** – **£5.5m** – Bryan Mbeumo is also classified as a midfielder along with Sergi Canos. Mbeumo also takes up an attacking role that is much more advanced. The French winger sits in 1.3% of FPL squads currently.

   In terms of numbers, he made 44 appearances in the Championship last season and scored 8 goals along with 10 assists.

   He is dynamic and combines really well with Ivan Toney in attack to make a formidable pair upfront. If he hits his peak form in the Premier League, he could go on and be a huge differential for many FPL managers.

4. **Janelt** – **£5.0m** – Vitaly Janelt could also be one of Brentford’s heroes that goes under the radar. He usually plays as a central defensive midfielder who can provide a strong base for Brentford’s back-line. He also has the ability to provide a lot more when he pushes forward in attack.

   Our Opinion? – Keep him on the bench in your FPL teams.

### Forwards

1. **Toney** – **£6.5m** – Ivan Toney is, without a doubt, the hottest deal in FPL right now. He is very highly owned by FPL, where he is currently owned by 33.8% of FPL managers worldwide. His ownership also places him at 2nd in the list of players in the "Forwards" category of the game, where Ollie Watkin leads him in 1st.

   In the Championship, he has made a total of 45 appearances with just one appearance as a substitute. There is no doubt that he will be Brentford’s man upfront as he has fixed his place in the starting XI after an impressive campaign with the Bees in the Championship.

   He is usually injury-free. Brentford are highly dependent on the goal-scoring prowess of Ivan Toney, as he recorded a total of 31 goals in the Championship last season. He is on penalty-duty as well for the Bees.

   As FPL managers, when a player costs 6.5m in the game and has that stature, numbers, and points potential in the FPL game, then you simply can not ignore the fact that he is an investment worth making in the FPL.

   Our Opinion? – We assume that Brentford will get off to a strong start. Consider Toney in your FPL teams till Game-week 5. Based on his form in the first 5 weeks, you can consider keeping him or shipping him out to another forward.

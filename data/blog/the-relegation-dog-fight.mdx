On Saturday the 27th of February, it demonstrated how desperate a few teams in the bottom six are to stay up ahead of the upcoming 2021-22 Premier League Season. An 8:30pm (IST) start at the Hawthorns saw West Bromwich Albion take on an impressive Brighton side who’ve kept five clean sheets in the last eight Premier League games. Those Clean Sheets were impressive as they included Clean Sheets against Tottenham and the Premier League champions Liverpool at Anfield.

Moving forward, Saturday evening was action-packed with West Brom getting the early lead through Kyle Bartley’s well-directed header. However, Brighton didn’t hold back. Brighton like to create and pass their way past the goal line. The Seagulls brought in their armoury to get past a stubborn "Big Sam" defence. It just wasn’t meant to happen for the boys from Brighton. Another disappointing day for Graham Potter in the office. Two disappointing penalties from Groß and Welbeck have cost Brighton 3 massive points.

In the past two weeks, Brighton have been victims of their own downfall when it comes to their quality upfront. They’ve got the personnel upfront, but their goals are in a drought. Brighton have created multiple opportunities from open play in the last two weeks, including the game against West Brom. However, the conversion of those opportunities into goals was far from what the score line had to show us. On the other hand, the stats tell their own story. To be precise, Brighton have created 66 chances and have just scored 1 goal against Crystal Palace. In short, Brighton can’t find a way to achieve their goals.

Throughout the season, the Seagulls have had the character to keep pushing to seal victory against any side. Graham Potter has built a style of play where his boys build play from the back, draw the opposition out and take advantage. It is pleasing to the eye to watch Brighton when they’re on song. Unfortunately, they have not been able to pull the strings together.

As far as Big Sam and West Brom are concerned, they’ve still got a long way to go to secure their place in the top flight next season. But Big Sam and his boys deliver another defensive performance when it matters the most.

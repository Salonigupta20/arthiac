### 1. Thibaut Courtois: 7.5

The Belgian keeper was made to work in both halves of the game. He made a total of 5 saves in the game.

He was brought into action during the final 20 minutes of the game.

He will enjoy the terrific save he made in the second half of stoppage time.

### 2. Dani Carvajal: 7.5

The right back is still working his way into full swing after his injury.

He seems to be taking a lot of confidence in himself and in his performances since his recall into the Spanish national side.

Linked up really well with Marco Asensio and progressed forward with real purpose. He was impressive in both halves.

### 3. Eder Militao: 8.5

The young Brazilian centre back will be leaving the European shores by performing at the highest level once again as he was rock solid covering up areas of danger that Rayo Vallecano brought along with them.

He made a total of 3 interceptions.

### 4. David Alaba: 8

The Austrian centre back has been colossal to Real Madrid since his arrival from Bayern Munich.

He has shown how colossal he can be to Ancelotti's plans in the near future by being versatile.

He defended pretty well, but he could've done a lot better to avoid Falcao to head the ball into the back of the net. He was poor at that point as he was caught ball watching.

However, he supplied a world class assist earlier in the game as his venomous cross found Karim Benzema who converted the cross into a goal as he peeled off at the far post.

### 5. Ferland Mendy: 5

The left back never really had a good evening in the office. He had many heavy touches in the game and gave away possession easily.

He nearly got an assist as he back-heeled the ball to Benzema who fired it just above the crossbar.

### 6. Eduardo Camavinga: 6

Ever since the young French starlet made an impressive start to life at the Bernabeu, his performances have dipped slightly.

Camavinga began the first half in a sloppy manner.

However, he grew into the game and made a much more positive contribution in the game.

He carried the ball quite well forward, made a few defensive interceptions and pounced forward to cover any potential danger to the back line. Although, he nearly gave away a penalty at the end of the game.

However, replays showed that the Rayo player had already made significant contact with the ball before Camavinga's challenge came in. There was not enough there.

### 7. Casemiro: 4.5

The Brazilian defensive midfielder is probably struggling from fatigue at this stage of the season.

He's not been at his best lately and has been lacking the edge in his passing.

Carlo Ancelotti will be slightly concerned about his asset's performance levels.

### 8. Toni Kroos: 8.5

The ex-German international was sensational on a night which required Los Blancos to claim all 3 points.

He did really well to get Real Madrid out of tight spaces and got his team moving forward swiftly.

Burst into the box in front of his marker and placed his goal well beyond the keeper's reach.

Linked really well with Vini Jr. and Karim Benzema. Put in a defensive shift as well. Got booked in the game too for a cynical challenge.

Made a really good goal saving clearance off the line in the dying seconds of the game to calm the nerves of the Real Madrid faithful at the Bernabeu.

The German was the game's MVP as his stats were:

- 1 Goal
- 2 big chances created
- 70 passes completed
- Passing accuracy - 93.5%
- â…” dribbles completed
- 1 goal saving clearance

### 9. Marco Asensio: 7.5

After being left out of favour for a while, he got his chance and performed pretty well. Although, he could have done much better on the night.

He must be given credit for his assist to Toni Kroos as he cut inside and layed it quite well for Toni Kroos.

### 10. Karim Benzema: 7.5

The French forward was pretty good on the night. He linked up well with Vini Jr. and his teammates in and around him.

He timed his run well and read the cross coming in from David Alaba and converted it.

Nearly found the top right corner of the goal after two impressive back-heels from Vini Jr. and Ferland Mendy.

Although, he will be quite disappointed for missing a few sitters in the game.

### 11. Vinicius Junior: 8

The electric winger has not allowed events of his national side affect him after being left out and recalled into the national side.

As always, Real Madrid bank highly on his pace and finesse up front to carry the team forward and cause chaos to the opposition defenders.

He did just that for Real Madrid once again against Rayo as he continues to grow and develop as a player.

He nearly scored the goal of the season as he danced through to the Rayo defense beating 3 defenders and had a shot on target, but his attempt was cleared on its way to the net.

He deserved a goal or an assist today, but he'll be having much brighter days ahead of him.

## Substitutes

### 12. Lucas Vazquez: 5

Came on along with Hazard and wasn't able to keep the ball when Real Madrid were under pressure.

Didn't get enough time to get used to the rhythm of the game.

### 13. Eden Hazard: 5

Came in with less than 10 minutes left on the clock and held the ball decently. Caught offside at times. Put in a small shift.

### 14. Nacho: N/A

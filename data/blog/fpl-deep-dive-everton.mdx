From London, we went to Liverpool. This time, we take a look at Everton. It’s been a busy few weeks for the blue side of Liverpool with events off the football pitch. Nevertheless, we at ArthiacOfficial will focus on the events that are due to take place on the pitch in about two weeks.

The spotlight and the newspaper headlines were in bold as everyone focused on the appointment of Rafael Benitez.

Exactly a month ago, on the 30th of June 2021, Everton appointed the former Liverpool boss, Rafael Benitez, to take charge of the first team.

A month later, the Evertonians are still in disbelief that those at the top have decided to appoint the man who once called Everton a "small club" during his time at Liverpool as head coach.

Over a decade ago, in 2007, when Benitez was Liverpool’s head coach, he described Everton as a small club after a draw in the Merseyside Derby.

A decade later, he is appointed as Everton’s head coach, where he will be put under the pump if he doesn’t start delivering the results that the ambitious Evertonians have been waiting for.

Rafael Benitez has a resume that is worth considering, especially during his managerial stints at Liverpool, Real Madrid, Chelsea, Valencia, and Napoli, among a few European giants that he has managed and won silverware with.

Things have slightly gone downhill for Rafael Benitez after his short spell at Real Madrid, where he was sacked by Florentino Perez, who is a renowned figure in global football.

As always, in this article, we look into every department that "The Toffees" have to offer for FPL managers around the world who would want to consider a potential opening for Everton asset (s) to enter their FPL teams.

## Everton in 2020-21

---

The Toffees have been good for a while, finding their rhythm and flow, only to lose that flow that they've gathered in due time. An impressive away record for the Toffees has been taken into much delight by the Everton fans, but a poor record at home has lost them ground on some European football for another season running.

It is clear that the hierarchy at Everton are highly ambitious people who want to turn Everton back among the elite once again. The building of a new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock is a sign of where Everton aim to see themselves in the near future.

A world-class manager in Carlo Ancelotti gave hope that he was the right man in charge of putting Everton in contention for European football. But, the call from Real Madrid did not keep him for too long at Everton as he returned to the club where he won a dramatic Champions League Final with Los Blancos in 2014 against Atletico Madrid.

In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Everton got off to an electric start where they gunned down Spurs 1-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. That result was followed by a hammering 5-2 victory against West Bromwich Albion. Victories against Crystal Palace and Brighton & Hove Albion followed as Everton got off to four wins out of four.

The following week, they welcomed Liverpool to Goodison Park as the game ended in a 2-2 draw. Things were looking bright on the blue side of Liverpool.

Just then, Everton hit a dark spot in their Premier League season as they fell to high-flying Southampton, which was followed by losses to Newcastle United and Manchester United.

During the course of the Premier League season, Everton found a patch of good form and lost their way to hit a new low.

Their chances of European football were still alive before the final gameweek, although those chances were relatively small as they travelled to the Etihad, where they were blown away 5-0 by Manchester City.

Everton completed their season by finishing in 10th.

## What to Expect from Everton in FPL?

---

The Toffees have a lot of players that are worth considering, which FPL managers can look at in all three departments (Make that 4 if you wish to do so-Goalkeepers).

Before we talk about the players at their disposal, it is important that we take you through the management style of play and approach that Benitez looks to implement in his squad.

Benitez entered the job with the complete approval and unwavering support from the hierarchy at Everton. Rafa Benitez intends to do his work as a unit, with no perks, as he stresses the balance while putting in defensive and attacking efforts. He may ask his players to stay overtime and train in order to find the right balance. With this approach, he is unlikely to make many friends. But, if results come by, he may have gained the trust and faith of the Evertonians.

We expect Everton to be a side that provides FPL points all across the pitch. The word "balance" indicates that there will be a lot more defensive FPL points that this Everton side will provide as long as Benitez is in charge.

## Players as "Potential" Regular Starters

---

### Goalkeepers

1. **Pickford** - £**5.0m** - It is quite surprising that Jordan Pickford is priced at £5.0m for the 2021-22 Fantasy Premier League season. His display at the 2020 Euros was a good indicator that he is a premium goalkeeper that would be in good demand for FPL managers to look at.

   He is a vocal, commanding and acrobatic keeper who doesn’t give in until the job is done. His opening fixtures provide a really good window for him to provide clean sheets and save points for FPL managers that decide to invest in him.

   His opening 5-6 fixtures are really good in case you want to invest in him. If you want to keep going further with Pickford in goal, his first 10 fixtures provide a decent enough opening for FPL points.

   Pickford also won the golden glove at the Euros as he had 5 clean sheets and made 16 saves in 7 matches that led England to the finals of Euro 2020.

   **Our Opinion? -** Worth considering adding him to your FPL team.

### Defenders

1. **Digne** - **Left-back** - £**5.5m** - Lucas Digne provided his FPL owners with a sum total of 120 FPL points in a season that could have been much more impressive if Everton had a good defensive set-up.

   His assist in Game week 1 vs Spurs was a prime example of how he is capable of delivering a vicious ball into the box which his team-mates can make a real menace.

   Unfortunately, things went a bit downhill for the Toffees and Lucas Digne’s FPL points were halted due to the lack of clean sheets and potential bonus points.

   Under Rafa Benitez, Everton are expected to put in a much heavier shift when it comes to defending. But, at the same time, Everton are also going to provide good attacking points that will come from their wing-backs.

   Lucas Digne is a prime candidate from this Evertonian side to provide defensive and attacking returns. Below are his stats in the Premier League:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2018-19 | 35      | 4     | 4       |
   | 2019-20 | 35      | 0     | 7       |
   | 2020-21 | 30      | 0     | 9       |

   **Our Opinion? -** Look at how Everton are in the first few fixtures of their Premier League campaign. However, we believe that Everton will get off to a decent start that would get him FPL points.

2. **Keane** - **Centre-back** - £**5.0m** - Micheal Keane is set to be the main centre-back for Everton during the 2021-22 Premier League season. He provided a serious threat in set-pieces with his height and heading prowess.

   He was a part of Ancelloti’s defensive set up as he took centre stage in Everton’s back-line for most of the season.

   He has Premier League experience under his belt during his time at Burnley too. At Everton this season, he has the chance to impress Rafa Benitez. Micheal Keane is physically adapted to take on the responsibilities that Rafa Benitez will bestow on him and he will be key if Everton are to provide decent FPL returns. Below are his stats while he is at Everton.

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2017-18 | 30      | 0     | 1       |
   | 2018-19 | 33      | 1     | 2       |
   | 2019-20 | 31      | 2     | 0       |
   | 2020-21 | 35      | 3     | 1       |

   **Our Opinion? -** Invest in him based on your own gut feeling. He is certain to provide handy differential points at some stage in the season.

3. **Mina** - **Centre-back** - £**5.0m** - Yerry Mina has had some competitive football lately as he was a part of the Colombian national team squad in Copa America. He will be at the helm of Everton’s back-line as he has always been.

   He is a ball winner in the air and is pretty sound when it comes to tackling. He is one of the primary targets that Lucas Digne will be aiming for when Everton are on the attack with a set-piece.

   However, slight niggles and injury concerns have halted his regular starts for Everton. If he is fit and running, he can be a really good differential in your FPL sides with the potential for an odd goal or two. Below are his stats during his time at Everton:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2018-19 | 13      | 1     | 0       |
   | 2019-20 | 29      | 2     | 1       |
   | 2020-21 | 24      | 2     | 0       |

   **Our Opinion? -** He will be a good FPL option for 1-2 weeks. Keeping him in your team beyond 1-2 weeks can prove costly.

4. **Godfrey** - **Centre/Right-back** - £**5.0m** - Everton found a gem when they invested in the services of Ben Godfrey, who is a player with a very-high work rate. At 23 years of age, he has impressed many in the Everton camp as well as the European giants.

   His potential was recognized while he was at Norwich when he scored 4 goals and provided 2 assists in the 2018-19 season.

   Carlo Ancelotti used him in multiple positions last season. He was a centre-back, right-back and a right-wing back too at times. He has the potential to explode this season provided that he gets his chances.

   He is quick and recovers really well under pressure.

   **Our Opinion? -** Consider him or Lucas Digne if you want a defensive Everton asset.

### Midfielders

With Everton, there are not many regular starters as they might all be rotated depending on the opposition that they face and the physical state of their players. Nevertheless, here are a few potential options you could consider for the "short-run."

1. **James** - £**7.0m** - With a 4.3% ownership in FPL as of the 30th of July 2021, James Rodriguez could be a really good differential option for FPL managers that decide to go for him in the opening few fixtures.

   He has always been Carlo Ancelotti’s boy. Last season, he got off to an electric start in Everton colours as he impressed many pundits and fans with his vision.

   Under Rafa Benitez, it is not clear as to how James Rodriguez is going to be used.

   The downside to James is that he picks up injuries on a regular basis as he sits out for 1-2 (possibly 3) games if his legs have not recovered in time.

   **Our Opinion? -** We assume that he will be an impactful substitute if he gets on the field. Benitez will bank on his decisiveness to get goals for Everton.

   If you are opting for a differential in the opening 3-4 weeks, consider James Rodriguez.

2. **Doucoure** - £**5.5m** - During his time at Watford, he has been a mighty figure in central midfield. Without a doubt, he is a willing runner on both sides of the pitch.

   He carries with him a decent attacking threat from central midfield with his passes. He also has the odd goal in him which could make a difference in a game.

   A foot injury kept him out for large portions of the 2021-22 Premier League season. He will be fresh and raring to go.

   **Our Opinion? -** Avoid. There are many better attacking fantasy assets in the same price bracket.

### Forwards

1. **Richarlison** - £**7.5m** - Richarlison is in fine form for Brazil in the Olympics. He has also featured for Brazil in the recently concluded Copa America. In the Olympics, Richarlison holds the top spot for the top scorer award with 5 goals to his name.

   He is quick, decisive and looks to run at you with real drive and agility. He has proven his importance in the last season, when he went on a run of scoring in consecutive games for Everton.

   Rafa Benitez will be relying on the pace of Richarlison to get the team forward, and this boosts the potential for Richarlison to get more Fantasy Points. Below are his stats in an Everton shirt:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2018-19 | 35      | 13    | 1       |
   | 2019-20 | 36      | 13    | 3       |
   | 2020-21 | 34      | 7     | 3       |

   **Our Opinion? -** If you are struggling to get Dominic Calvert Lewin into your team, and if you prefer having an Everton asset in your forward line, then Richarlison is not a bad shout at all. Richarlison is also among the potential penalty takers on the side.

   Consider the fact that Richarlison will not be available at the start of the Premier League season as he has taken part in the Copa America as well as the Olympics.

   By the time Richarlison gets back to the starting XI, it might be too late to get on board as Everton's fixtures start to shift slightly against them after gameweek 10

2. **Calvert-Lewin** - £**8.0m** - In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Dominic Calvert-Lewin got rolling in his goal-scoring boots at the start of the campaign.

   He has a towering leap and a thunderous header in him, which boosts the potential for him to get FPL points. At £8.0m, there are a few cheaper options, but you could say that DCL also has the surprise factor in him to get an additional goal or two to get Everton ahead in the game.

   He links up well with Lucas Digne and Sigurdsson in attack. That gives him a fair advantage to be priced at £8,0m.

   He hasn’t taken most of his scoring chances in the previous season. He has got 31 big goal-scoring opportunities/chances, which is more than any of his Everton team-mates.

   His goal-scoring numbers could have been much more attractive for FPL managers to consider.

   This season, he will be a key figure in providing goals from open play as well as set-pieces.

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2016-17 | 11      | 1     | 0       |
   | 2017-18 | 32      | 4     | 6       |
   | 2018-19 | 35      | 6     | 2       |
   | 2019-20 | 36      | 13    | 1       |
   | 2020-21 | 33      | 16    | 0       |

   **Our Opinion? -** If he gets off to a flyer, he has to be considered in your FPL teams. If he gets off to a slow start, then, having him for a few weeks would be ideal. Watch out for his form.

Good evening, FPL managers! Last week had a pretty decent average world-wide FPL score of 43. However, those numbers remained decent as the budget assets and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah got on the score sheet in terms of goals and assists.

Well, a few big names like Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, and Romelu Lukaku failed to deliver, which may have dented your weekly progress in your mini leagues as you might have slipped out on a few green arrows in GW6.

However, in this article, we take a look at the silent assassins who go under the FPL radar in terms of popularity and who could be the **differential** factor in your side to boss the others in your mini-leagues.

We provide a comprehensive look at the differentials that have a high potential for FPL returns in GW7. We have picked 1 player from each position which you could consider investing in.

## Goalkeeper

- **Jose Sá** - **£5.0m** - **2.5%** - The Portuguese goalkeeper arrived in Molineux this season following his transfer from Greek side, Olympiakos this summer.

  The impact that the goalkeeper has made on this Wolves side has gone unnoticed. He is a keeper who will be up for the fight until the very end as he is not afraid to come out and make himself big in front of his opponent.

  A largely proactive keeper who has immense reflexes in his armoury. Talk about his fingertip save off Mason Greenwood in GW3 vs. Manchester United.

  He knows what it's like to win, having won three league titles before joining Wolves.

  However, he comes to England with good pedigree as he won the golden glove in the Greek Super League in the year 2020. Of course, you can't compare Greek and English football, but it just goes to show the calibre that this young man has when he's got his gloves on. He is athletic and quick when he's on the dive.

  This season, Wolves have not been banked upon for their defensive performances as multiple errors have let them down, but looking over at their fixtures, Jose Sa could be an investment you would want to make with fixtures pretty decent over the next 8 gameweeks.

  To be precise, he has the potential to be a decent long-term investment from GW7 to GW14. You could exclude West Ham out of the equation. However, those are still good fixtures to consider for fantasy managers, as he is currently priced at **£5.0m** and is owned by only **2.5%** of Fantasy Premier League managers worldwide.

  He also has an **assist** to his name as he found his Mexican teammate, Raul Jimenez, last week against Southampton.

  So far, he has scored **28 FPL points** with **14** of those coming in last week as he recorded **6 saves**, **a clean sheet**, **an assist** and all **3 bonus points**.

  He sounds like a good FPL option to us as he pulls out saves on a regular basis. We hope he delivers the goods in the following games.

## Defender

- **Azpilicueta** - **£6.0m** - **4.4%** - The Spanish right-back has been colossal to Thomas Tuchel as the empire he continues to build at Stamford Bridge.

  Given that Chelsea come into GW7 with a slight doubt over their recent performances in the Champions League and the Premier League, it is worth considering that they faced Manchester City and Juventus in the last 5-6 days.

  If you look at the numbers that Azpilicueta has put up this season, it is still quite reasonable as he has managed to get **26 FPL points** in **6 gameweeks**.

  He has the potential to really be **"the difference"** in your FPL squad even if he comes on as a substitute.

  In the game against Aston Villa, Cesar Azpilicueta came on as a second-half substitute and provided an assist during his 26-minute cameo on the field.

  That goes to show that Tuchel prefers his Spanish right-back to use his energy and drive to go up front and provide the goods and services to his forward men with Lukaku and Mount waiting in the box. Yes, it is a very small sample size, but it is worth taking that into consideration with Reece James out for GW7.

  Chelsea's fixtures from GW7 look evergreen with green flags up until GW11. They face Southampton at home, Brentford away, Norwich at home (which looks really tasty even for Chelsea's defenders as Norwich are really struggling aerially this season), Newcastle away and Burnley at home.

  All these sides have a decent, yet effective attacking force in their armoury. However, with the calibre that Chelsea have in their defensive line, we should see a fair number of clean sheets and bonus points.

## Midfielder

- **Smith Rowe** - **£5.3m** - **4.5%** - This starlet has been one of the most pleasing sights to see if you are an Arsenal fan.

  The rise and growth of this young lad just goes to show how colossal he could be for Mikel Arteta's plans and not to forget, your FPL plans as well.

  At the start of the season, Arsenal really struggled to find their "mojo" as they found it difficult to get it ticking in midfield.

  Last season, with the arrival of Smith Rowe on the main scene, we saw more than a glimpse of what this guy brings to the table at the Emirates stadium.

  Fans have already dubbed him the club's "next Mesut Ozil," as he keeps things ticking and flowing at the heart of that Gunners midfield.Yes, comparing him with Ozil at this stage of his career may seem far-fetched for now and we totally agree to that.

  But his movements on and off the ball have been impressive. For example, his goal against Spurs last weekend at the Emirates stadium was a prime example of what Ozil used to do throughout his career.

- As an FPL manager, you ultimately need points, which is for certain, but at the end of the day, you want to see your FPL assets go the extra yard to make something happen for their team and that is exactly what Smith Rowe is all about.

  He pulls the strings and manufactures things in midfield and he also ensures that he delivers the end product right at the end. He is a willing runner.

  In GW6, he recorded **12 FPL points** as he **scored** a **goal** and **provided** an **assist**, ultimately providing **2 bonus points** as Arsenal dominated the opening 35 minutes on Sunday afternoon at the Emirates stadium.

  With his energy and drive in midfield, Arteta cannot afford to drop him and keep him on the bench, especially when this looks like it could be the upward tick in his form which would be crucial for many FPL managers world-wide.

  Make sure you get a ticket and catch his flight for the next 7 weeks.

## Forward

- **Maupay** - **£6.5m** - **3.1%** - Neal Maupay has been tremendous for Graham Potter and his side, as it's been two weeks in a row now since he has delivered for the seagulls at crucial moments in the game when the opponent seemed to have got their work done for the day.

  On Monday night a few days ago, Crystal Palace were staring down the barrel with 3 points besides their name when Maupay got the ball in the final 45 seconds of the game and delicately chipped it over Vicente Guaita as Brighton claimed a dramatic point on Monday night at Selhurst Park.

  That goes to show that he has the desire and work ethic to get on the score sheet even on an off day in the office.

  With Danny Welbeck once again being sidelined due to injury, it seems as though Neal Maupay is set to get an extended run of games in the starting line-up for Graham Potter.

  After all, the Seagulls will be counting on the French striker to deliver the goods in the coming weeks.

  As an FPL manager, if you want to go with 3 strikers in your line-up, then so be it. Neal Maupay provides a really good budget option for your FPL side.

  In the game against Crystal Palace, he claimed all **3 bonus points** and played the entire 90 minutes of the game.

  Brighton take on Arsenal and Norwich in GW7 and GW8 and, with just **3.1%** of FPL managers **owning** him, he is a short-term investment that you could make into your side.

  Given his form, you could sell him in GW9 and GW10, but his fixtures after that look really promising with Brighton facing Newcastle, Leeds, Southampton and Wolves in fixtures up until GW17.

  At the same time, the French forward is also on penalties, which certainly raises his appeal to be considered.

  Brighton are a creative side with the likes of Trossard, Cucurella, and Groß in midfield, and Maupay is a foxy striker in the penalty box along with his skills on the ball. He provides good all-round value at a price tag of **£6.5m**.

  So far this season, he has scored **31 FPL points** in 6 gameweeks as he averages up to **5.16 FPL points per game**.

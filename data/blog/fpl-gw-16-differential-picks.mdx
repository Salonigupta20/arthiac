Since Manchester United have been going through a short series of managerial changes, the outcast Diogo Dalot has been getting his opportunities to come through in the starting XI. The Portuguese right-back was barely used even as a substitute while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remained in charge of the first team squad.

However, it's about time that he get his opportunities and he did really well in the game against Crystal Palace in GW15. Man Utd have always been criticized for not being able to cause some threat to the opposition with an overload from their right hand side with their right-back, **Wan-Bissaka (£5.1m)** not being able to assist his teammates from an attacking point of view.

It seems as though Ralf Rangnick has seen this and has deployed Diogo Dalot at right back who is a very cheap asset to invest in. Adding to that, Dalot is a much better attacking full-back in attacking terms.

In case you decide to invest in him. He will be a huge asset to your side as Man Utd still need to start ticking under their new interim manager. This will provide Dalot with many more starting opportunities in their **run of favorable fixtures**. Through the eye test against Crystal Palace, Dalot has been able to zip multiple crosses into the box for **Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.4m)** and co to capitalize on.

Against the Eagles in GW15, Dalot scored 8 points as he kept a clean sheet and claimed 2 bonus points. He may have not been pleasing on the eye so far (which is expected of a player who has been warming the bench for large chunks of the season), but he will get in the groove as the fixtures roll by.

He is currently a good differential to invest in as he is owned by just **0.7%** of the game and by the looks of it, he is guaranteed to get regular starts as the season progresses.

## 2. Bernardo Silva (MCI- MID): **£7.6m**

The Portuguese is arguably one of the Premier League's most in-form players in the league so far this season. Before the season began, Pep Guardiola had earlier stated that Bernardo was one among those who wanted to leave the club, but those fears can be put to bed as the midfielder is in the best form of his career so far.

In **GW15**, against Watford at Vicarage Road, Bernardo Silva scored **2 goals** which gave his side a comfortable 3-1 win against the Hornets. Subsequently, Bernardo received all **3 bonus points** to reward his owners with a total of **15 FPL points**. He has been in sublime form this season scoring **5 goals** in the last **5 Premier League** games where he has played **all 90 minutes**. By the looks of it, Pep banks on his fitness and finesse up front for the Citizens.

In the game against Watford, Bernardo Silva ran the show as he put his statement forward by scoring his second, which was a worldie.

**Here are his stats:** **Premier League**

| **Premier League** | Stats     |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| Games              | 14        |
| Games Started      | 14        |
| Minutes            | 1210      |
| Average mins/game  | 86.4 mins |
| Goals              | 7         |
| Assists            | 2         |
| FPL Points         | 84        |
| FPL Bonus Points   | 12        |

The Portuguese has been playing as a right winger and as a right-sided midfielder as well in the starting XI for Man City. He has justified his regular playing time along with his regular starts due to the following:

| **Goal Involvement**  | **28%** |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| **Scoring Frequency** | **43%** |

Through the eye test, Bernardo Silva arrives in the box as a silent assassin and finds his target more often than not. He's even created multiple opportunities/chances for his teammates to cling on.

With **5 goals** in the **last 5 Premier League** games, there is no reason why Pep would decide to bench his in-form Portuguese midfielder. That's the kind of stuff you need from a mid-priced FPL asset. Although, you'll still have to hold and accept the fact that there will be a point in time where Bernardo will be rotated based on Pep's roulette.

Man City play **Wolves** in GW16 and with visitor's struggling with the fitness of their left-backs, **Ait Nouri (£4.3m)** and **Marcal (£4.2m)**, there is no perfect contender to take over duties on the right wing for Man City to exploit the left-hand side of Wolves' defense.

Expect him to reward his owners with more FPL points!

When he's out there, grab hold of Man City's Portuguese!

## 3. Dennis (WAT-FW): **£5.7m**

Watford's forward, Emmanuel Dennis has been maintaining his wild form since the start of the season and he remains as one of the league's top in-form forwards.

**Here are his stats: Premier League**

| **Premier League** | Stats     |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| Games              | 14        |
| Games Started      | 13        |
| Minutes            | 1084      |
| Average mins/game  | 77.4 mins |
| Goals              | 6         |
| Assists            | 6         |
| FPL Points         | 75        |
| FPL Bonus Points   | 12        |
| Goal Involvement   | 60%       |

Dennis has been really good upfront for Watford popping up in crucial moments for the Hornets. His pace up front on the wings causes a lot of threat to the opponents. His wild form has earned him a price rise by **£0.7m** so far. He is clearly a budget forward, but the numbers he registers on a regular basis tempts FPL managers to invest in the forward.

Claudio Ranieri has been impressed with his star forward along with **Joshua King (£5.8m)**, but Dennis remains the go-to man for FPL managers to consider as he is a much more attractive option to look at.

**His Goal Involvement percentage (60%) is higher than Joshua King who stands at 40%.**

The upside with Dennis is that you could get FPL points through assists and goals while Joshua King is highly dependent on supplies and his primary source of FPL points is through goals only.

Subsequently, Watford have a run of three to four favorable run of fixtures coming back to back with Brentford, Burnley and Crystal Palace on the horizon from GW16-18. They take on Wolves in GW19 at Molineux.

With Ranieri stamping his authority at Vicarage Road, Emmanuel Dennis is set to continue raking up FPL points. He is cheap and affordable. A good option to consider with **Ivan Toney (£6.7m)** out through Covid-19.

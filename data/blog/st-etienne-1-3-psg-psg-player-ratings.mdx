## PSG PLAYER RATINGS

---

### 1. Gianluigi Donnarumma: 6

He had a pretty quiet day in goal, but he'll be disappointed with the goal conceded as he was at fault with a weak save. He had a few easy saves to make and was a spectator in the second half.

### 2. Achraf Hakimi: 6

The Moroccan couldn't make a big difference from the right hand side as he was well looked at by the hosts. Contributed well defensively.

### 3. Marquinhos: 8.5

The Brazilian will be satisfied with his goals on a rainy and cold afternoon. However, he will be disappointed for not being able to keep a clean sheet.

Bounanga gave him a good run for his money in the first half, but Marquinhos will be thankful for his defensive teammates who bailed him out.

A good solid header in stoppage time of the second half to seal all 3 points.

### 4. Sergio Ramos: 6

He was handed his debut which was the main headline in the game apart from the fact that MNM started once again as a trio.

He looked rusty which was expected especially after a long injury lay-off.

### 5. Juan Bernat: 5

The Spaniard struggled to push forward with real threat and menace. He also received a booking.

### 6. Danilo Pereira: 6

The Portuguese mopped up really well in the centre of the park. He even made a few good clearances in his own box.

He's doing exactly what he's brought in to do. Kept things simple in midfield.

### 7. Idrissa Gueye: 5

With Danilo in the side, his role was to push forward and assist MNM and Angel Di Maria in attack, but his work was cut out defensively as he too kept mopping up in midfield. He made 9 recoveries in total in the game.

He was subbed in the final quarter of the game.

### 8. Angel Di Maria: 7.5

He was crucial in the latter stages of the game as his composure and cool in front of goal gave PSG the lead.

It was the Argentine duo that combined well to get the goal. He will be instrumental in this PSG side even though MNM will grab the headlines week in and week out.

### 9. Lionel Messi: 8.5

The Argentine looks like he's getting into his groove after a slow start to the season. He provided the assist for the equalizing goal.

He played mainly in midfield and looked to orchestrate things from the middle of the park.

He provided a cheeky assist for Di Maria for the second goal. He ended the game with 3 assists as he laid it on a plate for Marquinhos.

3 assists to his name and he will be happy with his performance on a rainy afternoon.

### 10. Neymar: 5

The Brazilian superstar couldn't light it up on the field. He was poor on the night and he couldn't really make an impact on the game.

He was later stretched off after receiving a hefty challenge on his ankle. It might be a concern for Pochettino moving forward.

### 11. Kylian Mbappe: 5.5

The French youngster was largely stopped in his pursuit to sprint forward with venom. He didn't look comfortable. It was probably because of the weather. Lacked composure while he was in front of goal.

However, he failed to convert a platinum opportunity in front of goal. He had his fair share of chances later on in the game which he failed to capitalise on.

## Substitutes

12. Leandro Paredes: 4 - Came on a substitute and he couldn't make a significant impact in the game.
13. Eric Ebembe: 4 - He was quiet.

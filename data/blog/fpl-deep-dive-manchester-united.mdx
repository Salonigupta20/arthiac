Alright then, if we covered Manchester City yesterday, then there was no escape from the red side of Manchester. Right? Lol. We got you covered this time around as we look at the men from Old Trafford.

This historic club has always been a fan favourite as the years have rolled by. Yes, over recent years, the club has not been doing well in the Premier League and the competitions they play in, but it isn’t long enough till the sleeping giant wakes up. Isn’t it?

Manchester United have always been at the centre of almost all transfer speculation as they have continued their search for players that will bolster their overall squad. It seems as though the Glazer’s have invested a fair chunk of funds into the club.

The summer of 2020-21 will go down in Manchester United’s history as they have secured the signings of Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho into their ranks. This is a statement that the club intends to make that they are not here to mess around.

Well, the results speak for themselves and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (OGS) and his boys will be tested, questioned and judged based on their results.

Moving forward, Manchester United finished second in the table in the 2020-21 Premier League season, but it has not been a sweet fairytale story for them in cup competitions. Here is how they fared in 2020-21:

| Competition      | Final Stage   | Lost Against    |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Carabao Cup      | Semi-Final    | Manchester City |
| FA Cup           | Quarter-Final | Leicester City  |
| Champions League | Group Stages  | RB Leipzig      |
| Europa League    | Final         | Villareal       |

Well, it’s not a pretty good statistic to look at if you belong to the red side of Manchester, but it is what it is. Manchester United fans will be hoping that this season is fruitful as their signings this season bring a lot of hope to those that are faithful to the "Red Devils."

In this article, we will be looking at Manchester United’s assets that are worth considering for your FPL teams. As always, we look into every department that the "Red Devils" have to offer for FPL managers around the world that would want to consider a potential opening for an asset (s) from the red side of Manchester to enter their teams.

## What to Expect from Manchester United in FPL?

Where do we start? Well, with the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Cavani, Jadon Sancho, Varane, Greenwood and Shaw, there is so much to look at in this Manchester United squad and their potential as FPL assets.

**In Defence**-With the signing of Varane, Manchester United are set to be a really good defensive unit this season, which helps FPL managers to make decisions much easier if they decide to invest in Shaw and Wan Bissaka.

**In Midfield**-With the recent signing of Sancho, we can expect Manchester United to flourish upfront in front of goal. Their midfield is set to attract FPL managers and provide tons of FPL points for those that invest in their midfield.

**In Attack,** Cavani is the most reliable centre-forward that Manchester United have. When they have the likes of Bruno, Sancho, Rashford, and Greenwood behind you, expect Cavani to get many opportunities to find the back of the net.

## Players as “Potential” Regular Starters

### Goalkeepers

1.  **Henderson** - **£5.0m** - Henderson is set to be first in line when OGS has to choose who remains in between the posts. David De Gea has been in decline over the last couple of years and this has prompted OGS to select Henderson as his first choice goalkeeper.

    Henderson currently sits at 3.2% of the FPL squads for now.

    During his time at Sheffield United, Henderson has been exceptional in goal for the Blades (Sheffield United). There is no doubt regarding the quality that Dean Henderson has in his arms.

    He is a commanding goalkeeper and he is not afraid to come out and clear a potential opportunity for the opposition to score a goal.

    During his loan spell at Sheffield United, Dean Henderson pulled out many saves and he was one of the reasons why Sheffield United finished the 2019-20 Premier League season on a high.

    Last season, in 13 appearances for Manchester United, Dean Henderson kept 4 clean sheets. Dean Henderson’s save percentage was 78.4%.

    Yes, he did start a few games, but to his defence, the pressure and expectations that you have to deal with while wearing that Manchester United shirt are through the roof. Despite all that, Henderson has stood tall against those expectations.

    He is a reliable shot stopper. This season he will get more minutes as a starter than his teammate De Gea and he is guaranteed to provide many more FPL returns and clean sheets this season.

### Defenders

1.  **Shaw** - **Left-back** - **£5.5m** - We are sure that when you were tinkering around your FPL squad, Luke Shaw was definitely a key member of the 5-man defence that you can opt for.

    His rise over the last two or three years has been phenomenal. Luke Shaw has been growing into a very attractive FPL asset ever since the 2018-19 Premier League season.

    Last season, Luke Shaw made a total of **32 appearances** for Manchester United. In those 32 appearances, he supplied a total of **5 assists** and scored a huge goal against Manchester City.

    It is important to consider that Luke Shaw is coming from a very impressive Euro campaign with England. At the Euros, he scored a goal in the final versus Italy and supplied 3 assists as his contribution to England's success on their road to the final.

    His form has to be noted. If he continues this form at the start of the season, he will be an FPL asset that can not be ignored at any cost.

    **Is it Worth the Investment?**

    Hell Yeah!!!

    He is definitely worth the investment. With Manchester United solidifying in defence with the signing of Varane and the likes of Maguire and Wan Bissaka, Luke Shaw is expected to have a much more attacking role this season. There is no doubt about the attacking threat that he carries under his belt.

    Last season, Luke Shaw scored a total of **124 FPL points** in **32 appearances**. On average, he scored **3.87 FPL points** per game he played.

    Those numbers are definitely going to be on the rise this season, as we can assure you that Manchester United will be a tougher nut to crack in the 2020-21 Premier League season.

    Here are his stats:

    | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2014-15 | 6       | 0     | 0       |
    | 2015-16 | 5       | 0     | 1       |
    | 2016-17 | 11      | 0     | 1       |
    | 2017-18 | 11      | 0     | 0       |
    | 2018-19 | 29      | 1     | 4       |
    | 2019-20 | 24      | 0     | 0       |
    | 2020-21 | 32      | 1     | 5       |

    Those numbers look promising and they are set to increase further. He has also improved a lot defensively.

    **Our Opinion?** - Since he is coming from the back of an extended run at the Euros, you can expect Luke Shaw to be on the bench for the opening three to four weeks.

    He will then be in contention under OGS to be a regular starter. Since we expect Luke Shaw to have a much more attacking role, he is set to provide more assists and goals to FPL owners that decide to invest £5.5m in the English left-back.

2.  **Maguire** - **Centre-back** - **£5.5m** - Harry Maguire has been a meme over the last few seasons as a Manchester United centre-back. But he has shunned his critics in the 2020-21 season and the fans will hope that he continues to be impressive as years go by.

    Harry Maguire is a colossal figure for Manchester United in defence.

    At the same time, he is also a good header of the ball. He has won many aerial duels defensively as well as attacking wise for Manchester United.

    When Manchester United have an attacking set-piece, Maguire is a primary target for Luke Shaw and Bruno Fernandes to target.

    Last season, Maguire played a total of 3048 Premier League minutes and scored a total of two goals and provided one assist. His numbers could have got much better, but, unfortunately, an injury put him out for the last few games of the Premier League season.

    With the arrival of Varane, Maguire is set to be a much more attractive FPL asset as he is primed to play more minutes and also have a much better record in front of goal. He is a regular starter under OGS.

    **Worth the Investment?**

    There are many other attacking FPL defenders at **£5.5m** who are set to provide much more attacking returns. Lucas Digne (Everton), Castagne (Leicester), Stones (Manchester City) and Cresswell (West Ham) all belong in the £5.5m category for defenders that will provide the same or equivalent FPL points next season.

    There are even other options **below £5.5m,** such as Firpo (Leeds United), Reguilon (Spurs) and Coufal (West Ham) who are at **£5.0m** and provide much better value as an FPL asset.

    **What Is Our Opinion?-** Since Luke Shaw is expected to sit out for the first few weeks, an investment in Harry Maguire for the first few weeks can be made and then a swap for Luke Shaw later on in the season can be easily done.

3.  **Wan-Bissaka** - **Right-back** - **£5.5m** - Wan-Bissaka is not known much for his attacking threat upfront as he lacks the quality and decisiveness when he delivers crosses into the box.

    If anything, he is an exceptional tackler of the ball and he recovers really really well. But, even though he is known for his defensive attributes, he still has attacking returns that are impressive and worth considering.

    He was a regular starter for OGS last season and there is no doubt regarding that. Last season, he made a total of 34 Premier League appearances. In those appearances, he scored a total of **2 goals** and provided **4 assists** in total.

    **Worth the investment?**

    He currently sits in 11.3% of FPL squads. Last season, he scored a total of **144 FPL points**. On an average, he scored **4.23 FPL points per game**.

    There are other FPL options, such as Digne and Cresswell, that you could look at.

    **Our Opinion?** - Wan-Bissaka has not taken part in any international tournament this summer. So, he will be fresh and raring to go when the season kicks in.

    If you want an FPL asset from Manchester United’s defence, then Wan-Bissake is a decent shout.

4.  **Varane** - **Centre-back** - **£6.0m** - We expect Raphael Varane to come in at £6.0m defender in FPL. He has been buzzing to join Manchester United for the past one or two months.

    This kind of determination and buzz from a player goes to show that he is ready to provide and give everything for the club. As an FPL manager, it is important that we take this into consideration since it will help FPL make a much better decision if they decide to invest in a centre-back that is pretty costly.

    A centre-back who arrived from Real Madrid has won everything in world football. In Raphael Varane’s CV, he won the World Cup with France in 2018.

    Adding to his trophy collection, he has 4 Champions League trophies to his name. He has multiple La Liga titles and multiple Spanish domestic cups on his CV.

    He arrived at Real Madrid at a very young age and has cemented his spot after the departure of Pepe. There is no doubt regarding his defensive qualities, as he is quick and he recovers really well immediately.

    From an attacking perspective, he has a lot of attacking potential when it comes to set pieces as he has a really good header in him. Physically, he is strong and he will adapt and adjust well to the Premier League.

    **Is it Worth the Investment?**

    It is too early to say whether he is worth the investment or not. For a start, given that Man United's fixtures are pretty easy, you can decide to have a punt on Raphael Varane.

    However, consider the fact that when the season starts, there are a lot of defensive errors made by teams. A lot of penalties are conceded by teams.

    Hence, an investment in Rafael Varane would be worth it when we are midway through the season.

    **What Is Our Opinion?-** At £6.0m, he might be a little bit more difficult to predict if we can invest in him as an FPL asset. But, if he provides clean sheets and goals, you can definitely invest in him as an FPL option as he will provide clean sheets and bonus points.

**Midfielders** -

1.  **Fernandes** - **£12.0m** - Since he signed for the Red Devils in 2019-20, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation for Manchester United when he first came in. He set the league apart by scoring 8 goals and providing 7 assists as he came in midway through the season.

    Most of us have seen the quality that this Portuguese midfielder has when he is on the ball. He is very exciting in terms of his passing and decisiveness when he finds a player.

    He has the eye of an eagle to spot a runner while he is anywhere on the pitch.He is a huge FPL asset as he provides assists as well as goals.

    He is on set-piece duty as well as penalties. His penalty record is pretty impressive as well.

    In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Bruno Fernandes was the top FPL points scorer amongst everyone else in the game. He finished the season on 244 points, whereas Kane came in second and finished on 241, Salah finished on 231 and Son finished on 228 FPL points respectively.

    Last season, Bruno Fernandes made **37 Premier League appearances** in which he scored a total of **18 goals** and provided **12 assists**. Those numbers speak for themselves.

    To be able to provide 18 goals and 12 assists at £10.5m last season is just mind-blowing. It just goes to show the capability and the quality that this man possesses when he is on the pitch for Manchester United.

    **Is it Worth the Investment?**

    Hell YEAH!!!

    He is a regular starter under OGS and last season he played the most number of minutes, which totalled 3105.

    At the same time, his numbers could have been much more impressive as he is constantly providing an attacking threat from the wings, or for that matter, from anywhere on the pitch. If the forward men of Manchester United are able to convert the chances that he creates, then we can see another colossal and attractive FPL season from Bruno Fernandes, which is sure to exceed **250 FPL points**.

    The only downside is that, now, with the arrival of Jadon Sancho, there are doubts that he may drop a little bit deeper in midfield, which will reduce the chances of him providing FPL points for us.

    As mentioned earlier, last season he scored a total of **244 FPL points** in **37 Premier League appearances**. On average, he provided **6.59 FPL points per game.** Those returns are through the roof!!!

    **Our Opinion?-** If you can find a way to get him in, get him in!!!

    At the start of the Premier League season, there were many penalties awarded. Bruno Fernandes is on penalty duty, especially with Rashford out.

    Given that Manchester United have an easier fixture list in the beginning, you can expect Bruno Fernandes to get points.

    At the same time, we do not expect Sancho to come in immediately in the playing XI. So Bruno is set to go upfront more often.

2.  **Rashford** - **£9.5m** - To start off, Marcus Rashford is set to undergo a shoulder injury in the next few days. His shoulder injury will take some healing and recovery time.

    His return to the pitch will take a while and we do not expect him to be in full flow once he returns to the pitch.

    At the start of the 2021-22 Premier League season, he shouldn’t be considered immediately. We assume that he will be out until September and it might take a while to find his groove. If he is fit and his shoulder recovers well from the surgery, we may see Rashford scoring goals and being a real FPL asset by November-December.

    **Worth the investment?**

    At **£9.5m**, if Rashford wears his scoring boots and goes on a scoring streak, then we can consider him as a potential FPL option that we can invest in.

    With Manchester United becoming strong at the back, Rashford is expected to have a minor contribution defensively. This will enable Rashford to be on his heels to hit teams on the counter to score goals and provide assists.

3.  **Sancho** - **£9.5m** - Manchester United have tried for over a year to avail the services of Jadon Sancho. They finally got him in and we, as FPL managers, have the opportunity to sign him as well. Let’s talk a bit more about him.

    He made his first appearance in the German Bundesliga in 2017. He has just gone on and become a much more prolific player as he grew up in Dortmund.

    He made a total of 137 appearances (all competitions) for Dortmund and scored 50 goals in Dortmund colours. Here are his stats in the Bundesliga for Dortmund:

    | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2017-18 | 12      | 1     | 4       |
    | 2018-19 | 34      | 12    | 14      |
    | 2019-20 | 32      | 17    | 16      |
    | 2020-21 | 26      | 8     | 11      |

    Adding to his Bundesliga stats, he has 5 goals in the Champions League so far.

    He creates multiple opportunities for his teammates to score. He is a versatile winger who can take up positions on both wings. This is a really threatening attribute to have in your game, as he is quick and really skillful.

    He loves to cut in and score his goals (which is, btw, really delightful to watch). He has a very high potential to provide assist points whenever he gets on the pitch. The goals he scores are also going to be an additional benefit for FPL managers in case you decide to invest in him.

    **Worth the investment?**

    He had a very quiet Euro, but he will be fresh and ready to go all guns blazing when he gets his opportunity.

    Having said that, he may not get directly into the main line-up for Manchester United. OGS may take his time until Sancho fits into the way that United play.

    Since Sancho doesn’t have much Premier League experience, it would be ideal to wait and watch. An investment in Mahrez at **£9.0m** (for a few weeks), Havertz at **£8.5m** and a few other cheaper alternatives at the start of the Premier League season will be worth it.

    **What Is Our Opinion?-** Wait and Watch with Sancho. If he trains well and adapts well to the way that Manchester United play, then you can expect him to get into that starting XI immediately.

    Especially with Rashford out, Sancho may come in sooner than expected into the starting XI. We need to wait and see what OGS has to say during his press conferences.

4.  **Pogba** - **£7.5m** - At Manchester United, Paul Pogba has not been able to replicate his brilliance that he shows when he is with his national team. When he is with the French National team, he is on another level. That same level has not been demonstrated on the field when he is in Manchester United Colours. This begs the question, ‘Why isn't Paul Pogba the same at Manchester United."

    Year after year and season after season, a huge chunk of Pogba’s season has been that he is not at his best for Manchester United. It is the same old story with Paul Pogba, that he is not able to **express himself** while he wears the Manchester United jersey.

    Injuries have also played a major part in the downfall of Paul Pogba as he has suffered multiple injuries throughout his time at Manchester United, which has put a dent in his overall performances.

    In the 2020-21 Premier League season, he made a total of **26 appearances** and scored **3 goals** and **provided 3 assists.**

    Recently, at the Euros, he scored a goal and provided an assist as well. Usually, we also look at a player’s form in pre-season or their national teams.

    But, for Paul Pogba, it is a different case, as he is unable to express himself completely at Old Trafford.

    **Is it Worth the Investment?**

    Yes, he is worth the investment **only if** he gets flowing. He will certainly get into a small patch of good form where he will provide assists and goals for a few weeks and then tail off.

    He will get back into that good patch of form after a while. But, we are not sure when that little patch of good form will come. It is pretty unpredictable with Paul Pogba.

    Here are his stats:

    | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2016-17 | 30      | 5     | 4       |
    | 2017-18 | 27      | 6     | 10      |
    | 2018-19 | 35      | 13    | 9       |
    | 2019-20 | 16      | 1     | 3       |
    | 2020-21 | 26      | 3     | 3       |

    As the numbers suggest, he is worth the investment when he gets going and scores goals. For a **£7.5m** midfielder, he provides decent numbers, but FPL managers look for players who constantly start week in-week out. Paul Pogba isn’t a regular starter.

    **Our Opinion?** - Invest in him when he is fit and performs well in midfield.

5.  **Greenwood** - **£7.5m** - Mason Greenwood is arguably one of the most talented hotshot youngsters in the Premier League. Period.

    Last season, Mason Greenwood made a total of 31 appearances in which he started 21. During that time, he scored 7 goals and supplied 2 assists.

    He is set to get more game time this season, especially when Cavani will not be able to start every week and Martial is out of favour in the Manchester United ranks.

    He is classified as a midfielder in the FPL, but he takes up the "Centre-forward" position many times.

    As FPL managers, this is what we look for to see FPL assets getting additional points for the goals they score.

    **Worth the investment?**

    Definitely!

    He will start the season as Rashford is out. Greenwood has got some serious pace and talent in him where he can take those defenders on a roll.

    Now, many players can drop their shoulders and run at you, but we need to see rewards coming from them. Mason Greenwood brings those rewards in the form of assists and goals.

    He will learn from Cavani how to operate in the penalty box. But while the Uruguayan is on the pitch, Greenwood is on the wings and he has a demon's eye for goal.

    | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2018-19 | 3       | 0     | 0       |
    | 2019-20 | 31      | 10    | 1       |
    | 2020-21 | 31      | 7     | 2       |

    Those numbers show the goal scoring threat that he possesses when he is on the ball. There is no doubt that his numbers will be much more impressive this coming season provided that he is fit.

    **Our Opinion?** - If you cannot afford Bruno and Sancho in your FPL squad, Greenwood is definitely worth considering in Manchester United’s attack.

6.  **Lingard** - **£7.0m** - Lingard has got a new lease of hope after his loan spell at West Ham where he was on fire as a Hammer. He took up positions as a Central attacking midfielder at West Ham.

    It will be difficult to see where he fits into this Manchester United team. He may have regular appearances for Manchester United in domestic cup competitions, but his minutes in the Premier League for Manchester United look very bleak/limited.

    As a result, we may not see him explode.

    If you decide to get him into your FPL teams, he will be a good punt for a week or two.

    There is a lot of talent in the midfield ranks of Manchester United and there is a lot of competition for places as well.

    **Our Opinion?-** Avoid. If he gets regular game time (which is hard to see), then consider investing in him. There are many other cheaper FPL assets, like Buendia, Emile Smith Rowe, Saka, and Raphinha.

7.  **McTominay** - **£5.5m** - Scott McTominay had a good and impressive season in midfield for Manchester United last season. Goals came much more regularly for the man from Scotland.

    Last season, McTominay made a total of 32 Premier League appearances where he scored 4 goals and provided 1 assist.

    This season, he may have a much more defensive role to play as Manchester United have a lot of attacking players in their squad.

    **Our Opinion?** - Avoid him for now.

### Forwards

1.  **Cavani** - **£8.5m** - The Uruguayan has been impressive last season by scoring multiple goals. There were many doubts being raised if he could keep up to the demands of the Premier League.

    But, Edinson Cavani has been exceptional for Manchester United in front of the goal that they have extended his contract on a short-term basis.

    The centre-forward scored a total of **10 goals** and supplied **3 assists** despite **starting** in just **13 games**. He was used much more as an impact substitute as Manchester United were competing in the Europa League.

    **Is it Worth the Investment?**

    Overall, he made 26 Premier League appearances for the Red Devils.

    His minutes on the pitch are not guaranteed and at £8.5m, you want to invest in a player that is a regular starter.

    As mentioned earlier, he made 26 Premier League appearances last season. He scored a total of **99 FPL points**. On an average, he scored **3.80 FPL points per game,** which is not too bad **considering** the fact that he started in just **13 games**.

    Yet, you still want more from an **£8.5m** player.

    **Our Opinion?** Consider other cheaper FPL assets like Bamford, Ings, Watkins, Calvert-Lewin, Antonio, and Toney.

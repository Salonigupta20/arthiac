Amongst all the buzz and excitement surrounding the arrival of the Portuguese superstar, the Red Devils
have sealed a 1-0 victory over Bruno Lage's Wolves at Molineux.

Man Utd were far from their best and if they had to lose that game against Wolves, there would be question marks over the impact Cristiano Ronaldo could have had on this blunt Man Utd side.

It is safe to say that Mason Greenwood didn't let those questions appear in bold in the papers as headlines on Monday morning.

The travelling Man Utd supporters were in full swing during the game as they carried a Cristiano Ronaldo cardboard across their end of the Molineux stadium.

Speaking about the game, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho were handed their first full debuts under Ole and they have been given a taste of Premier League football and it's a taste that certainly got their eyes wide open and what they have in store this season. The demands and expectations will be sky high after the Red Devils have brought in staggering recruitment this summer.

Wolves began with a much higher intensity and took the game to Man Utd as Adama Traore burst through tight spaces and found a way to put Varane and Maguire under immense threat. He bounced off Fred and Wan-Bissaka with his sizzling pace and found a way to get forward on multiple occasions.

Wolves' first chance of the game came when Traore skipped past Fred and Pogba and laid the ball beautifully for Jimenez to score, but the Mexican centre-forward couldn't find the net as his shot brought about a save from De Gea.

The game didn't slow down after that, as Wolves would come again to threaten Man Utd as they were on the counter following a Manchester United set-piece as Trincao skipped past Fred, dropped him on the floor and went for goal, but Aaron Wan-Bissaka blocked the attempt on goal with a tremendous tackle which prevented Wolves from scoring their second within 5 minutes on the clock.

United were careless at times while defending, as Sancho's poor clearance fell to Joao Moutinho, who scooped it over the bar in the 12th minute of the game.

After a lot of threats and flair from the boys in Golden Yellow, Bruno Fernandes found the back of the net in the 38th minute of the game, which was ruled out for offside.

At the stroke of half-time, Bruno found Greenwood making a run on the outside as he found the teenager with ease and Mason took a shot with his left-foot, which brought about a stunning finger-tip save from Jose Sa to deny the opportunity for United to take a half-time lead.

Once again, as the second half got underway, Trincao burst through and nut-megged Harry Maguire to create yet another opportunity for Wolves, but the Portuguese couldn't find the all-important cross as Raphael Varane came across to block the cut-back pass.

Wolves found themselves with yet another counter-attack opportunity to hurt Manchester United as a series of a few forward-flowing passes put Wolves in a very good attacking position, but it's the same old story with the boys in golden yellow as Trincao bottles the opportunity to score from a very promising position in front of the goal.

The events that took place in the 68th minute of the game were the highlight of how the fortunes of the Wolves have taken an upside turn.

A corner from Joao Mouthino was met by a soaring header from the Moroccan - Romain Saiss as David De Gea had to pull out a save which fell kindly to Saiss at point-blank range, which brought about yet another save from the Spanish goalkeeper. De Gea rolled back the years with that staggering double-save!

Bruno Lage didn't ask his boys to stop and Wolves kept pushing to get the opening goal of the game as Neves had an attempt on goal saved by De Gea.

De Gea's counterpart, Jose Sa, was also called into action as he palmed Paul Pogba's shot over the crossbar and the game began to heat up as the final 15 minutes of the game approached.

The game found its first goal as Greenwood found the back of the net with just 10 mins left on the clock and that was a clear indication of the spark that United needed from one of their showmen on the pitch and the young teenager delivered the goods for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

There was a huge disagreement around the ground as the Wolves fans made their boo's heard. They had their point as the replays and freeze images showed that during the build-up to the goal, Paul Pogba raised his feet high and went through full-fledged into a tackle that was extremely dangerous as Tim Sheerwood mentioned that it would have broken the shin of Ruben Neves by a couple of inches. That was certainly a "career-breaking" tackle!!!

The tackle was reviewed by VAR and, surprisingly, the decision wasn't overturned by a rash challenge from Paul Pogba and Greenwood's goal stood.

According to us, the goal should've been ruled out as Pogba's challenge clearly went against the rules of fair-play. Even though the Premier League has facilitated the use of added contact and physicality to let the game flow, Pogba's horrendous challenge had no place in the game we all love.

There is a debate stirred by some mentioning that there was a 50-50% attempt on the ball, but when you see a replay like that, it is in the best interest of the concerned player and the Premier League (in general) to overrule the goal and save the overall image of the league.

Anyway, on the other hand, Wolves may have to blame themselves for not delivering the end product in front of the goal as they lack the quality to convert opportunities into goals.

They created chance after chance and Bruno Lage will be deeply disappointed after his side have not been rewarded for their efforts in front of the goal as they have had 57 attempts on goal so far in the first 3 game-weeks of the season and have not managed to score a goal as they have now lost 3 games on the trot with a 1-0 scoreline.

## Player Ratings (Starting XI)

1.  **David De Gea: 9** - He did have a pretty shaky start to the 1st half of the game as Wan-Bissaka bailed him out, but if it wasn't for the saves he made in the second half, United would've not created their own record of being undefeated in 28 away games in the trot which is a new record.
2.  **Wan-Bissaka: 6** - Apart from the goal-saving tackle in the first half, Wan-Bissaka didn't offer anything in attack as his contribution in the game was solely on defence which is an aspect of his game that he needs to improve on. One thing is for certain, Cristiano Ronaldo will not be a happy man if he doesnâ€™t get deliveries from the right flank.
3.  **Varane: 8** - He had an impressive debut by providing an assist and a clean sheet for Manchester United. He will be over the moon as his contributions got United over the line.

    Yes, he had a shaky start in the 1st half as he missed a few passes. He was also outdone by Romain Saiss in the air.

    But overall, he was impressive as he tracked Adama Traore and Trincao on multiple occasions and cut down the threat from the flanks as he covered Maguire at times.

    A good start to his Man Utd debut!

4.  **Maguire: 6** - He controlled and Marshalled the backline as he had to and did the basics as a central defender as his presence was required at the back to control and contain the Wolves attack.
5.  **Luke Shaw: 5** - He found spaces up front when Man Utd were on the attack, but never made any significant difference in doing so. He was largely outshone by Nelson Semedo.
6.  **Fred: 4** - In the 1st half, Fred was in a huge mess as Paul Pogba had to direct him where to be during the game. He was taken apart by Adama Traore and Trincao. He found himself unsettled for large portions of the game.
7.  **Pogba: 5.5** - The French-man may have been lucky to escape a red card, but he gets a relatively low rating as he couldn't make the difference for his team by sitting in behind playing deeper in midfield. He too couldn't contain Traore and Trincao while defending.

    Although he found Bruno Fernandes in the 1st half, Pogba was far from his best in the first two game-weeks.

8.  **Daniel James: 6** - The Welshman was selected in the starting line up to make a difference with his pace while the Red Devils were on the attack.

    Although he managed to get a few crosses, his movements on and off the ball didn't pay off.

9.  **Bruno Fernandes: 6** - The Portuguese was immensely quiet by his high standards in this game and picked up a yellow card for his frustration which was silly.

    He found pockets of space and found a few passes as well in between, but he was way beyond his best.

10. **Sancho: 5** - Started the game slightly on the bright side as he showed what he is capable of and showed glimpses of his quality during his time at Dortmund, but the youngster struggled as the game wore on and he was not to be seen as he will be disappointed with his debut in the red jersey.

    Defensively, he was very casual and got lucky after his clearance fell kindly to Moutinho, who couldn't make the most of the error by Jadon Sancho.

11. **Greenwood: 8** - The Teenager was there for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as his team as he provided the winning goal. What a sensational finish that was!

    During the game, he had a few attempts on goal, which forced a few saves from Jose Sa.

    He was certainly one of the best players on the pitch by far, 2nd on the list after De Gea and level with Varane.

Moving forward, Manchester United will be delighted that they have got over the line against Wolves, but deep down, OGS knows that he has a lot of work to do to get his team up and running.

Manchester United fans will be eager to see the return of their own superstar - Cristiano Ronaldo in 2 weeks, and Ole will hope that Ronaldo gets goals time and time again to make the Red Devils serious title contenders this season.

### 1. Caoimhin Kelleher: 6.5

Given that he had nothing much to do, he deserves the rating he's got as he was calm and collective with the ball at his feet.

### 2. Robertson: 7.5

He was once again running his legs out from the left hand side as he was good in the game.

Contributed to the clean sheet as well.

### 3. Virgil Van Dijk: 8

He was totally comfortable with the ball at his feet. Had no worries aerially and he had the eye to sling in his long ball from the back. Exceptional once again.

### 4. Joel Matip: 7.5

He was cool, calm and collective at the back. Didn't hesitate and found himself surging forward many times in the attacking half for Liverpool.

### 5. Trent Alexander Arnold: 7

He found Salah with a few breath-taking passes from the half-way line in the first half.

His passes were good and he was looking to push forward on multiple occasions without bearing much fruit.

### 6. Keita: 6.5

He was comfortable on the ball and he didn't look rusty. Looked comfortable and confident when he was on the ball.

### 7. Henderson: 6

Kept things steady in midfield and supplied it wide for the boys on the wing to stride forward.

### 8. Milner: 6.5

He certainly had a rusty start in the opening exchanges of the game, but the veteran got back into his groove and grabbed an assist in the game.

### 9. Mane: 9

The Senegalese winger is continuing to show that he is getting back to his usual best and he kept Watford on their toes from the left wing side of Liverpool's attack.

He scored the game's first goal and capitalised from a sublime cross from Salah.

### 10. Firmino: 10

He ensured Jurgen Klopp that he still remains as the number 1 pick in that centre forward role off Diogo Jota.

He was rested from international duty and he bore fruit at Vicarage road by scoring a fantastic hattrick as he poached home for Liverpool twice.

### 11. Salah: 10

He gave Danny Rose a real scare throughout the game as he kept haunting him time and time again.

The Egyptian king grabbed a world class goal and a world class assist in the game as he is heads above shoulders over everyone else around him.

## Substitutes

### 12. Kostas Tsimikas: 6.5

Came on for the injured Robertson and showed good amounts of energy and did relatively well in the game.

### 13. Oxlade Chamberlain: 6

Came on in the game and caused much more threat to Watford's defensive line with his fresh legs.

### 14. Neco Williams: 7.5

The young Welsh right back grabbed an assist in his short cameo in the game as he provided Firmino the match ball.

### 1. Aaron Ramsdale: 7

The goalkeeper didn't have much to do during the whole game. He had a very quiet afternoon as his workload was reduced to making short passes and claiming set-piece deliveries that were thrown at him from the Hornets.

However, he was really dodgy in the final 5 minutes of the game as he nearly squandered Arsenal's clean sheet.

### 2. Takehiro Tomiyasu: 6

The Japanese right back had a decent afternoon as he kept Dennis quiet in the opening exchanges of the game.

But, he was put to the test when Sarr switched flanks and took the game onto him.

He was poor in ball possession.

### 3. Nuno Tavares: 7.5

He had a really good game in both halves of the field as he made multiple interceptions during the game and kept rushing forward with intent and purpose. He's currently grabbing onto his opportunities really well.

### 4. Ben White: 8

The English centre back also had a really good game at the back for the Gunners. He was good aerially and made key interceptions during the course of the game.

Slid in well and denied the goal scoring shots from Kucka and Rose.

In attack, he provided a good dummy run for Smith Rowe to capitalise on.

### 5. Gabriel: 6.5

He had a quiet afternoon as he was not being put to the test by Ranieri's boys, although he had his header saved by Ben Foster earlier on in the game.

### 6. Bukayo Saka: 7.5

Danny Rose had a horrible afternoon at left back as Saka came gunning down at him on many occasions.

Saka was slightly unlucky for his goal which was ruled out for offside. He did misplace a few passes during the game.

### 7. Albert Sambi Lokonga: 6

By the looks of it, Lokonga had a good game on the day and he had a lot more influential minutes under his belt. He clearly took advantage of Watford's laid-back performance.

### 8. Ainsley Maitland-Niles: 6.5

It was a good day out on the field for the man who had made his intentions clear that he wanted to leave the club during the summer transfer window.

He began the game on a very bright note as he supplied 2 sublime deliveries onto his teammates. One of them could have given him the assist for Saka, which was ruled offside. He had a quiet second half, but he kept good possession of the ball.

### 9. Emile Smith Rowe: 8.5

This young lad keeps going from strength to strength. He had a few moments in the game where he was off the pace in the game, but he kept driving forward in tight spaces as always.

A delightful finish in the opening 10 minutes of the second half into the bottom corner. He's keeping up with his good goal scoring form as he's got 3 goals in 3 Premier League games now.

### 10. Alexandre Lacazette: 6

He began the game pretty well, but he wore off as the game wore on as he dropped into midfield on a few occasions to link up play with his strike partner. Got subbed off for Odegaard.

### 11. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang: 5

He had a really poor game on the day as the highlight of his afternoon was that penalty miss. He got a goal ruled out for offside.

It was another bad night for the Gabonese striker to forget in an Arsenal shirt.

## Substitutes

### 12. Odegaard: 6

Got on for Lacazette and got play going in midfield for Arsenal.

Sadly, his goal was denied by his teammate.

### 13. Elneny: 5

He came in and tried to control the lead.

### 14. Gabriel Martinelli: N/A

---

## Watford

### 1. Ben Foster: 8.5

The veteran keeper played his 500th Premier League game and he deserves a rating of that standard as he kept Watford in contention for large chunks of the game.

At the age of 38, he made a stunning penalty save and held onto it pretty well before Aubameyang could come and poke it away from him.

He made multiple sharp saves in the game as he kept out Gabriel's header which was a save he should be proud of. He kept out Lokonga as well during the later stages of the game.

### 2. Kiko Femenia: 6

He was one of the Watford players on the field who looked to provide some decent fight while pushing up front. He had a decent game.

### 3. Nicolas Nkoulou: 6

He had a pretty good day in defence considering how poor Watford were in the game.

He got away with a close call on a penalty incident, but he was a tough nut to crack.

### 4. Craig Cathcart: 5.5

The centre back was tough and tall in set-pieces, but he struggled to contain the threat provided by Smith Rowe and Aubameyang by their movement.

### 5. Danny Rose: 2

The ex-Spurs man had a horrid afternoon in defence as he was torn apart from Saka. He was reckless on a few challenges and was fortunate not to get booked.

His clumsiness gave away a penalty for the Gunners. He was fortunate that Foster saved him from his blushes.

### 6. Mousa Sissoko: 4

The former Spurs player was positioned in a much more defensive role and did a lot of work to sweep up in midfield. Took a few hefty blows as well.

### 7. Juraj Kucka: 5

He was crucial for Watford as he worked really hard to get possession of the ball.

Unfortunately, he was a bit too reckless and got booked twice as he was eventually sent off.

### 8. Ozan Tufan: 3

He didn't do much in the game. Never really got himself in the game and struggled to get going against a full throttled Arsenal side.

### 9. Ismaila Sarr: 5

The winger was quiet in the opening exchanges of the game, but he was switched over to the other flank and provided a much more decent threat for Watford in the game.

### 10. Emmanuel Dennis: 5

He began the game on a rusty note and switched flanks with Sarr later on in the game. He was pretty decent in the game.

### 11. Joshua King: 6

The Norwegian striker tried hard to get something upfront for Watford, but he got booked earlier on in the game.

## Substitutes

### 12. Joao Pedro: 4

Came on and hardly made an impact to get Watford pushing forward with intent.

### 13. Cucho Hernandez: N/A

Couldn't make a difference in the game.

### 14. Ashley Fletcher: N/A
